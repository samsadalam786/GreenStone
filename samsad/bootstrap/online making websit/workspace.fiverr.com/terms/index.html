<p>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP EXISTS, OR WILL EVER BE CREATED, BETWEEN YOU AND FIVERR UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. FIVERR, ITS SERVICES, AND ITS FORMS, TEMPLATES, AND OTHER CONTENT ARE NOT A LAW FIRM OR A SUBSTITUTE FOR A LAW FIRM. FIVERR CANNOT AND DOES NOT RENDER ANY LEGAL SERVICES TO YOU, AND THE SERVICES ARE NOT, AND SHOULD NEVER BE, A SUBSTITUTE FOR LEGAL ADVICE OR LEGAL SERVICES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ANY FORMS, TEMPLATES, OR CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PRESENTED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF ANY KIND AND DO NOT CONSTITUTE LEGAL ADVICE, AND THAT ANY SERVICE THROUGH WHICH YOU USE A FORM OR TEMPLATE TO GENERATE AND/OR SEND A CONTRACT OR A DEMAND LETTER IS NOT A LEGAL SERVICE. NO INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICE IS INTENDED TO BE, AND MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO BE, FACTUAL OR ACCURATE LEGAL ADVICE. YOUR RELIANCE ON ANY FORM, TEMPLATE, OR OTHER CONTENT PROVIDED THROUGH THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. YOUR COMMUNICATIONS WITH FIVERR ARE NOT ATTORNEY WORK-PRODUCT AND ARE NOT PROTECTED UNDER ANY PRIVILEGE, INCLUDING ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE.</p>
<p>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT FIVERR IS NOT, AND WILL NOT BE, A PARTY TO ANY LEGAL DISPUTE THAT MAY ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY TO WHOM YOU MAY HAVE SENT A CONTRACT, DEMAND LETTER, INVOICE, OR OTHER DOCUMENT THAT YOU MAY HAVE CREATED USING A FORM, TEMPLATE, OR OTHER CONTENT PROVIDED BY FIVERR.</p>
<p>The Services allow You to create Your own documents with an eye towards memorializing certain details between You and Your clients. We do not review or edit the documents You create for completeness, grammar, spelling, consistency, accuracy or legal merit. We do not draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice, opine on Your legal rights or options, or apply the facts You enter to the law. If You need legal advice, or if Your back office service needs are substantial or complex, we encourage You to hire a lawyer. Our forms and templates may not work well for complex agreements. You agree to completely and accurately fill out any questionnaires required of those documents. You represent and warrant that any document You electronically sign via the Workspace Service will be truthful.</p>
<p>YOU AGREE TO REVIEW AND EDIT FOR YOUR PURPOSES ANY DOCUMENTS YOU CREATE USING THE SERVICES AND YOU SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE DOCUMENTS.

Accordingly, we cannot and do not guarantee that any information provided through the Services is current. Law relevant to consumers varies depending on the relevant jurisdiction (for example, the applicable U.S. state), and our documents are not, and cannot be, necessarily customized to Your jurisdiction. Your purchase and use of the documents made available through the Services for Your own personal purposes is not practice of the law by us or You.

<p><strong><strong>4. PAYMENT</strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Billing</strong>: Upon registering for a Paid Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that the Services have an initial and recurring payment feature, and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. FIVERR MAY SUBMIT MONTHLY OR ANNUAL (AS APPLICABLE) CHARGES WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY FIVERR) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE FIVERR REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, PLEASE GO TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SETTINGS PAGE ON WORKSPACE SERVICE.</p>
<p><strong>Invoices</strong>: An invoice for the Subscription Fee will be issued either on a monthly or annual basis (based on the chosen Paid Subscription Plan), starting on the date You registered Yourself or Your Organization to a Paid Subscription Plan. All invoices will include the Subscription Fee for a one (1) month / one (1) year period of use. We will continue invoicing You monthly and/or yearly (as applicable) until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10. All of our invoices will be sent to You, or to a billing contact whose details are provided by You (“Billing Contact”), by email. You are responsible for payment of all taxes in addition to the Subscription Fee.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic renewal and Termination of Paid Subscription Plan</strong>: At the end of each billing period your Paid Subscription Plan will be renewed automatically, and the applicable Services will automatically continue for the same duration, provided that You continue to pay the prescribed Subscription Fee when due. You may terminate the Paid Subscription Plan within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then applicable Paid Subscription Plan. Otherwise, You will be charged Subscription Fees for the next Paid Subscription Plan.</p>
<p><strong>Subscription</strong> <strong>Fee changes</strong>: We may change the amount of the Subscription Fee at our sole discretion from time to time subject to an advance notice to You. We may also offer users free trials, special discounts and/or waive certain Subscription Fees, subject always to our sole discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Payment processors</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We use a third-party payment processing companies (“<strong>Payment Processor</strong>”) to bill You through a payment account linked to Your account for use of the Services, as well as to enable processing of payments made to You for Invoices tendered by You. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor. By choosing to register to a Paid Subscription Plan, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect in accordance with the applicable payment terms and You authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “<strong>Payment Method</strong>”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it or its Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.</li>
<li>Currently, our Payment Processor for charging Subscription Fees is Stripe (https://stripe.com). We also use Stripe to process payments to You for invoices tendered by You. If you use Stripe, you agree to the Stripe terms of service (located at https://stripe.com/payment-terms/legal) and privacy policy (located at https://stripe.com/us/privacy).</li>
<li>In certain locations, you may also use WePay, Inc. (“<strong>WePay</strong>”) to process payments to You for invoices tendered by You. The WePay terms of service are available here: https://go.wepay.com/terms-of-service-us. The WePay privacy policy is available here: https://go.wepay.com/privacy-policy-us. If you use the WePay service, you agree to the WePay terms of service and privacy policy. If you have questions regarding the WePay terms of service or privacy policy, please refer to the WePay website (www.wepay.com) or contact WePay at https://support.wepay.com/hc/en-us.</li>
<li>In certain locations, we may also use PayPal to process payments to You for invoices tendered by You. If you use PayPal, you agree to PayPal’s terms of service (located at https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full) and privacy policy (located at https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reaffirmation of Authorization</strong>: Your non-termination or continued use of the Services reaffirms that we are authorized to charge You for those Services. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Services.</p>
<p><strong>Preferential pricing or discounts</strong>: You may from time to time be offered preferential pricing or discounts for the Services. Eligibility for such preferential pricing or discounts is conditional upon Your acceptance of responsibility for payment of any Subscription Fees in relation to all of Your Organizations, as applicable. Without prejudice to any other rights that we may have under these Terms or at law, we reserves the right to render invoices for the full (non-discounted) Subscription Fees due or suspend or terminate Your use of the Services in respect of any or all of Your Organizations in the event that any invoices for those Subscription Fees are not paid in full by the due date for payment.</p>
<p><strong>Automated Bank transaction data delivered into Your Workspace account</strong>: Where available, automated bank account transaction data feeds are generally provided to You free of charge. However, we reserve the right to pass on any charges related to the provision of bank feed data on a case-by-case basis at our sole discretion. We would first inform You via email to indicate what those charges are likely to be (as such charges may vary depending on Your bank and Your volume of bank feeds). You have the option to decide to discontinue use of automated bank feeds at any time. To exercise this option, You must notify us of which automated bank account transaction data feeds You want to discontinue. Upon receiving such notice we will arrange for such feeds to be terminated in accordance with each bank’s usual practices.</p>
<p><strong>30 Days Refund</strong>: If you are unhappy with your Paid Subscription Plan for any reason, you can ask for a refund within 30 days of your initial purchase. You can ask for a refund by contacting the Workspace support team. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days, depending on your financial institution, however, in some cases, refunds may take up to 30 days to appear in your account. If it has been more than 10 business days since the refund was processed by us, please contact your bank directly to inquire about the status of the refund. The refund is available for your first subscription purchase only. Other than as stated in this section, the Subscription Fee is non-cancelable and non-refundable.</p>
<p><strong>Workspace PAY</strong>: In certain locations we may offer certain users a seamless onboarding to payment processing services, without requiring users to connect their own Payment Processor to their Workspace account (such service is referred to as “<strong>Pay</strong>”). In order to use Pay, You will be required to accept the <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>. You also authorise us to forward Stripe your account information in order to process payments made to You by Your clients. We may require that you provide additional information as part of the onboarding or money withdrawal process. You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of any information about your account details as provided to us as part of the Pay service registration and/or money withdrawal process. In case that an ACH transfer is failed due to inaccurate information provided by You, You will be responsible to pay any transaction fees associated with such failed transaction.</p>
<p>If you choose to use Workspace’s Pay service, you agree to pay a service fee that is mostly based on the amounts paid by your clients through Pay for your services, and you will pay us such fee per each transaction, as set forth on the Paid Subscription Plan. Current fees are 2.9% + 30 ¢ per credit card transaction (+1% for international cards) and 1.5% per ACH. If you agree to refund any fees to your clients, you will pay us any transaction costs associated with such refund. We may deduct any of the abovementioned fees from payments that are processed through Pay. We may change the prices for Pay at any time. If we do change prices, such change will be notified on the Workspace website at least 30 days in advance. Your continued use of Pay after the price change becomes effective will be considered an agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Pay services.</p>
<p><strong>Chargebacks</strong>: Payments made by your clients through Pay may be disputed and charged back by your clients (a “Chargeback”). In the event of a Chargeback, You shall owe and immediately pay us the Chargeback amount, as well as any associated fees, fines or penalties associated by such Chargeback. We may deduct any such amounts from payments that are processed through Pay on Your behalf and/or from your account balance.</p>

<p><strong><strong>6. DATA PROTECTION</strong></strong></p>
<p>Fiverr shall process Subscriber Personal Data as Controller under Applicable Data Protection Laws. To learn more about how we use Subscriber Personal Data, please refer to our Privacy Policy, available through the link mentioned at the beginning of these Terms. To the extent that the Subscriber Personal Data includes Personal Data on Data Subjects other than the Subscriber itself, the Subscriber undertakes to inform such Data Subjects of our external Privacy Policy prior to the sharing of such Personal Data.</p>
<p>In relation to Service Data, the Subscriber shall act as Controller and Workspace as Processor for the purposes of making such Service Data available to the Subscriber and preparing reports and documents integrating such Service Data. The Subscriber acknowledges that it is responsible for compliance with its obligations as Controller in this respect.</p>
<p>With respect to the Processing of Service Data, we shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process such Service Data only on behalf of the Subscriber for one or more Business Purposes and on documented instructions from the Subscriber, including with regard to transfers of Personal Data to a third country, unless permitted or required to do so by Applicable Data Protection Laws or other European Union, Member State, or other law to which Fiverr is subject to; in the event of a conflicting legal requirement, Fiverr shall inform the Subscriber of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such information on important grounds of public interest;</li>
<li>not sell Service Data, nor retain, use, or disclose Service Data for any purpose other than the Business Purposes outlined in these Terms or other applicable agreement with the Subscriber;</li>
<li>only transfer Service Data to countries outside of the European Economic Area and Israel if it has provided appropriate safeguards as required by Applicable Data Protection Laws;</li>
<li>ensure that persons authorised to Process such Service Data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality;</li>
<li>implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, taking into account in particular the risks that are presented by Processing, in particular from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to Service Data transmitted, stored or otherwise Processed, and ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of Fiverr who has access to Service Data does not Process them except on instructions from the Subscriber, unless he or she is required to do so by Union or Member State law;</li>
<li>respect the following conditions for engaging another sub-processor:
<ul>
<li>We shall be authorised to engage other sub-processors, subject to informing the Subscriber of the intended change(s) concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors, thereby giving the Subscriber the opportunity to object to such changes;</li>
<li>Where we engage another sub-processor for carrying out specific Processing activities on behalf of the Subscriber, we shall impose on that other processor the same data protection obligations as set out in this clause, by way of a contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law. Where that other subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, we shall remain fully liable to the Subscriber for the performance of that other processor’s obligations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>taking into account the nature of the Processing, assist the Subscriber by appropriate technical and organisational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment of the Subscriber’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject’s rights under Applicable Data Protection Laws;</li>
<li>taking into account the nature of Processing and the information available to Workspace, assist the Subscriber in ensuring compliance with the Subscriber’s obligations under Applicable Data Protection Laws in relation to security of processing, to the notification of any breach of Personal Data to supervisory authorities and Data Subjects where relevant, to the carrying out of data protection impact assessments where required and to prior consultation of the supervisory authority;</li>
<li>at the choice of the Subscriber, delete or return all such Service Data to the Subscriber after the end of the provision of the Workspace Service, and delete existing copies unless Applicable Data Protection Laws requires storage of the Service Data;</li>
<li>make available to the Subscriber all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with these obligations set out in this clause and allow for and assist with audits, including inspections, conducted by the Subscriber or another auditor mandated by the Subscriber. Such audits may only take place at most once per year and during working hours, subject to a minimum of two weeks’ prior notice. The Subscriber undertakes to carry out such an audit through a qualified third-party independent auditor selected by the Subscriber and obliged in writing to maintain confidentiality towards us unless this third-party independent auditor is subject to the general statutory duty of professional secrecy.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to the Processing of Service Data, we shall be entitled to a reasonable fee from Subscriber for any assistance described herein, and we shall not be liable towards the Subscriber for any breach of Applicable Data Protection Laws that is attributable in whole or in part to the Subscriber or the Subscriber’s instructions.</p>

This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of Your relationship with us.</p>
