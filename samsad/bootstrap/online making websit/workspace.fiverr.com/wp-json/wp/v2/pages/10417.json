We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Preferential pricing or discounts<\/strong>: You may from time to time be offered preferential pricing or discounts for the Services. Eligibility for such preferential pricing or discounts is conditional upon Your acceptance of responsibility for payment of any Subscription Fees in relation to all of Your Organizations, as applicable. Without prejudice to any other rights that we may have under these Terms or at law, we reserves the right to render invoices for the full (non-discounted) Subscription Fees due or suspend or terminate Your use of the Services in respect of any or all of Your Organizations in the event that any invoices for those Subscription Fees are not paid in full by the due date for payment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Automated Bank transaction data delivered into Your Workspace account<\/strong>: Where available, automated bank account transaction data feeds are generally provided to You free of charge.

You have the option to decide to discontinue use of automated bank feeds at any time. To exercise this option, You must notify us of which automated bank account transaction data feeds You want to discontinue. Upon receiving such notice we will arrange for such feeds to be terminated in accordance with each bank\u2019s usual practices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>30 Days Refund<\/strong>: If you are unhappy with your Paid Subscription Plan for any reason, you can ask for a refund within 30 days of your initial purchase. You can ask for a refund by contacting the Workspace support team. The refund process usually takes 5-10 business days, depending on your financial institution, however, in some cases, refunds may take up to 30 days to appear in your account. If it has been more than 10 business days since the refund was processed by us, please contact your bank directly to inquire about the status of the refund. The refund is available for your first subscription purchase only. Other than as stated in this section, the Subscription Fee is non-cancelable and non-refundable.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Workspace PAY<\/strong>: In certain locations we may offer certain users a seamless onboarding to payment processing services, without requiring users to connect their own Payment Processor to their Workspace account (such service is referred to as \u201c<strong>Pay<\/strong>\u201d). In order to use Pay, You will be required to accept the <a href=\"https:\/\/stripe.com\/connect-account\/legal\">Stripe Connected Account Agreement<\/a>. You also authorise us to forward Stripe your account information in order to process payments made to You by Your clients. We may require that you provide additional information as part of the onboarding or money withdrawal process. You are responsible for the accuracy and completeness of any information about your account details as provided to us as part of the Pay service registration and\/or money withdrawal process. In case that an ACH transfer is failed due to inaccurate information provided by You, You will be responsible to pay any transaction fees associated with such failed transaction.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to use Workspace\u2019s Pay service, you agree to pay a service fee that is mostly based on the amounts paid by your clients through Pay for your services, and you will pay us such fee per each transaction, as set forth on the Paid Subscription Plan. Current fees are 2.9% + 30 \u00a2 per credit card transaction (+1% for international cards) and 1.5% per ACH. If you agree to refund any fees to your clients, you will pay us any transaction costs associated with such refund. We may deduct any of the abovementioned fees from payments that are processed through Pay. We may change the prices for Pay at any time. If we do change prices, such change will be notified on the Workspace website at least 30 days in advance. Your continued use of Pay after the price change becomes effective will be considered an agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Pay services.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Chargebacks<\/strong>: Payments made by your clients through Pay may be disputed and charged back by your clients (a \u201cChargeback\u201d). In the event of a Chargeback, You shall owe and immediately pay us the Chargeback amount, as well as any associated fees, fines or penalties associated by such Chargeback. We may deduct any such amounts from payments that are processed through Pay on Your behalf and\/or from your account balance.<\/p>\n<p><strong><strong>5.
