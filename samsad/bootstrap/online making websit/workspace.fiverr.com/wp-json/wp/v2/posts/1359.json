Successful freelancing isn\u2019t just about having cool software on your side, though it\u2019s certainly a plus that we promote. It\u2019s also about business knowledge. There is a learning curve that comes with any new business that has nothing to do with the actual product or service. Things like budgeting, time management, taxes, and other business fundamentals must be learned. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s something a lot of new creative freelancers struggle with. They spend so much time on perfecting their craft that they neglect these. This can lead to some very expensive mistakes. Underpricing yourself, failing to pay taxes on time, or even just spending more than you\u2019re making will turn you into the stereotypical starving artist. With just a little-applied knowledge creative professionals can avoid many of the traps.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One artist-turned-teacher decided to make courses that help freelance artists turn that starving artist trend around. Elaine Grogan Luttrull is a blogger, teacher, and author who teaches business skills to creative professionals that need a boost to their skills. Her website, and one of Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s great member benefits for freelancers, is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.minervafinancialarts.com.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Minerva Financial Arts<\/a>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elaine realized she needed to make a change in her life when she lost her enthusiasm for her work. Since 2007, she has developed courses and a coaching system to pass on basic business skills that all freelancers need. Some of her courses include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budgeting basics<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be or not to be\u2026 an entity (on whether to incorporate)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goal setting for portfolio careers<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two classes on using Excel to help your business<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pricing your creativity<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax classes<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two classes on running an arts organization<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also offers one-on-one coaching for professionals who want an extra edge. While these classes are catered to creatives, any freelancer could use the knowledge contained in these classes. We all could improve our budgeting, Excel skills, and portfolio management skills, not to mention pricing ourselves correctly in today\u2019s competitive freelancing world.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an idea of her teaching style and what she\u2019s passionate about, she\u2019s written a book called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/minervafinancialarts.com\/arts-numbers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Arts and Numbers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In the book, Elaine communicates the basics of financial knowledge for people running creative careers. The goal is not to make you a financial whiz, but to give you enough knowledge so that your career goals aren\u2019t handicapped by a lack of knowledge. The courses above are extensions of the knowledge contained in the book, so if you like the book, you\u2019ll love the coursework.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you\u2019re just curious, AND.CO is offering a special deal for its members. By using our coupon code from the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance Benefits<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> page (in the Finance section), you can get 20% off any of the classes from Minerva Financial Arts.
