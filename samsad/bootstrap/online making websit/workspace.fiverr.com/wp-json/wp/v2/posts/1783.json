Nothing is worse than doing a bunch of work for a client and then having them stiff you on payment. We\u2019ve all been there at least once. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the ways you can protect yourself:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Write a solid service agreement or statement of work contract and have the client sign it: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This contract should outline all the major activities, deliverables, assumptions, and exact payment terms for the work you are going to do for them. Dan Mall from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/superfriend.ly\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SuperFriendly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/agreement.superfriend.ly\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">great combination service agreement\/statement of work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that he has open-sourced to the freelance community. You are free to use it and I encourage you to do so. It comes in Keynote, HTML, and Microsoft Word versions. <\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wait for a retainer payment before you send the first major deliverable<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I always recommend asking for a percentage retainer payment from a client when you begin the project. This is acceptable to ask for when it\u2019s a *direct new client. You can start the work before you receive this payment, but don\u2019t deliver the first major deliverable until you receive the payment. Be firm on this.\u00a0<\/span>* By direct I mean a smaller client that hires you as an individual to do specific deliverables. Think an individual, small or medium size business, or a startup.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>For larger companies, understand their payment terms.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Before starting a big contract with a larger company, or a sub-contract with an agency, ask them what their regular invoice and payment terms are. For larger agencies or companies, they almost always pay on the company\u2019s regular payment terms, which usually means you get paid 2-4 weeks after a work period is finished, or deliverables are complete&#8211;just like if you were on salary. If the company is reputable, you should accept these terms if you want to work for them as they usually don\u2019t make exceptions. But if you really feel wary about trusting them to pay you after the fact, perhaps you shouldn\u2019t work for them?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/guide\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6692\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Invoice-cta2@x2-1-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1700\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Invoice at regularly scheduled intervals specified in the contract: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can space out invoices throughout the project, there is less risk of being left holding the bag with a large unpaid invoice at the end of the project. <\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Hold back deliverables<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only real leverage you have as a freelancer is the actual work that the client has asked you to do. If you are at all worried about getting payment, then you can hold back deliverables and final root files or code until the client sends you payment. This can get sticky, and you should be careful about which clients you do this with. If they are sketchy at all, I would recommend it. But if it\u2019s a reputable company and you don\u2019t feel there is a risk you won\u2019t get paid, then perhaps it may just create unnecessary conflict. You want to get repeat business, so it\u2019s not always a good idea to have your actions show you don\u2019t trust the client. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be Nice, Remind Regularly<\/strong>: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest mistakes freelancers can make is to be super aggressive and angry about missing payments. Clients respond much better to friendly, regular reminders than they do to a super angry email. Remind the person every week, without fail. Not more, not less, until you get paid. There could be a million reasons why a payment is late. Being professional and nice usually will eventually get you paid. Being angry and threatening usually guarantees you won\u2019t get paid.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Online Claiming Service:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 The company <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.peopleclaim.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PeopleClaim<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> reached out to me recently and it seems like an interesting service for freelancers. They&#8217;ll send the claim out by mail or email; if it&#8217;s not resolved by your deadline, you have the option to post it publicly. The site&#8217;s peer mediation process invites the public&#8211;including freelancers&#8211; to offer suggestions for resolution. It&#8217;s a powerful process that focuses on a mutually agreeable resolution sourced by people who know the business. It\u2019s quite economical as well. If you give it a try, please let me know how it goes! \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Legal Action: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your last remaining recourse may only be legal action. You could try a letter from your lawyer explaining that if they don\u2019t pay, they will be liable for legal action against them. The threat of legal action is sometimes enough to trigger payment. In New York City, there is a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gothamist.com\/2016\/10\/27\/freelance_protection_nyc.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new law that protects freelancers from wage theft<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. So if you are from there, you have more protection and recourse than in other places. But in most cities you are left with small claims court, and if the client isn\u2019t in your city, it\u2019s usually not worth the time to take legal action. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the end the best way to protect yourself is to use your freelance spidey-sense! If you feel like there is a decent risk this client is going to stiff you, then perhaps you shouldn&#8217;t work for the client in the first place. But if you must, then use all the tools above.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>For more about invoicing, take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/guide\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s complete guide to invoicing as a freelancer.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a freelancer it can be hard to protect yourself and enforce contracts if there is a disagreement.
