Luckily, the proliferation of the internet and social media have made the job search easier and more accessible. Keep these four tips in mind when you&#8217;re looking to land your next job so that you plant yourself in the right direction and stay motivated.<\/p>\n<h3>Tap into\u00a0your personal network<\/h3>\n<p>Similar to a traditional job search, leveraging\u00a0your personal network can be a highly effective way to find freelancing work. In fact, a 2016 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a> conducted by LinkedIn and the Adler Group revealed that 85 percent of jobs today are filled through networking. When done correctly, networking establishes relationships and builds connections that often lead to new opportunities. There are a few ways in which you can leverage your personal network to land freelancing gigs:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Send an email to friends, family, and colleagues (both past and present) that outlines your services and the types of work you\u2019ll be taking on. If available, link to relevant examples of your work and encourage those you share with to also send to their networks. Side note: only do this with your contacts that you regularly stay in touch with! If you haven\u2019t reached out to an individual in a while, try a coffee date first to rekindle the relationship vs. being so direct with your ask.<\/li>\n<li>Share a post on your personal LinkedIn and Facebook pages making your network aware of your services and asking friends to spread the word. Be sure to include photos or videos that exemplify your work in the post to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marketingcharts.com\/online\/visual-content-performs-best-on-social-media-marketers-say-69417\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">maximize engagement<\/a>. Take this a step further by posting your services to Facebook groups and LinkedIn job boards.<\/li>\n<li>Attend local networking events or join industry-specific organizations to expand your network. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Meetup<\/a> is a great resource for discovering and connecting with likeminded individuals in your industry, as is joining local organizations or associations that focus on your trade or passion.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Search job boards<\/h3>\n<p>Dating back to the inception of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.monster.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monster.com<\/a> in 1994, online job boards have become a great resource for researching and comparing employment opportunities. The use of job boards doesn\u2019t appear to be slowing down with the rise of social networking, either. A <a href=\"https:\/\/business.linkedin.com\/content\/dam\/business\/talent-solutions\/global\/en_us\/c\/pdfs\/Ultimate-List-of-Hiring-Stats-v02.04.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hiring study by LinkedIn<\/a> discovered that 60 percent of job-seeking individuals currently use online job boards to look for new opportunities. One of the most popular job boards today is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn Jobs<\/a>, which curates job recommendations based on your LinkedIn profile. With sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/q-freelance-jobs.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Indeed<\/a> and LinkedIn offering filters to find freelancing positions, it\u2019s easier than ever to search for specific types of projects you\u2019re looking for and receive instant results.<\/p>\n<h3>Earn word of mouth referrals<\/h3>\n<p>Consistently delivering freelance work that exceeds client expectations is a reliable way to bring in new leads. At the start of your relationship, define what going above and beyond means to your clients and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.loom.co\/how-to-turn-your-side-gig-into-a-business-b947c956efb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">set SMART goals for yourself<\/a> that position you to achieve those successes. A few noteworthy projects will get the ball rolling, and the larger your network, the farther the ball will roll.<br \/>\nTo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/forbes\/welcome\/?toURL=https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ryanrobinson\/2016\/04\/20\/six-figure-freelancers-share-their-best-advice-for-finding-success-and-clients\/&amp;refURL=https:\/\/blog.loom.co\/pro-tips-where-to-find-gigs-when-freelancing-cb9c3215499e&amp;referrer=https:\/\/blog.loom.co\/pro-tips-where-to-find-gigs-when-freelancing-cb9c3215499e#65a64e18119e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">quote Paul Jarvis<\/a>\u200a\u2014\u200aentrepreneur, best-selling author, and freelance designer at <a href=\"https:\/\/pjrvs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PJRVS<\/a>\u200a\u2014\u200a\u201cI\u2019ve never cold-called, put my services on job boards or marketplaces.

You don\u2019t have to compose long emails or newsletters, but thoughtful gestures like sending an article relevant to the clients\u2019 interests or industry will keep your name top of mind.<\/p>\n<h3>Use freelancing tools<\/h3>\n<p>While there are plenty of freelancer connection tools out there, not all platforms are created equal. When searching for the best freelancing tool to find new gigs, first evaluate what you want and need, such as HR services, invoicing templates, customizable user profiles, and legally binding contracts. Many reputable platforms offer a few of these services, but you should vigilantly research your options to find the best fit. If one tool doesn\u2019t have it all, don\u2019t be alarmed: there are a plethora of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.creativelive.com\/best-freelancing-tools\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">supplemental tools<\/a> that can do the trick.<br \/>\n(Hint: Fiverr Workspace is a <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">great\u00a0tool<\/a> to manage your freelance business from contracts to invoices, time tracking and beyond!)<br \/>\nFreelancing is serious business, but it should also be a fun and impassioned addition to your life.
