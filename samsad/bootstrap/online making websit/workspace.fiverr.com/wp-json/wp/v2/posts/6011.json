Are you ready to file the appropriate forms? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filing your taxes is certainly a major undertaking that you want to approach withcare to avoid penalties for late payments, underpayment of estimated taxes andinterest charges.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>It pays to be the boss<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it pays to be the boss, but you will also pay self-employment tax for the privilege. If you earned more than $400 from your freelance business in 2018, you owe <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selfemployment-taxcalculator.com\/\">self-employment taxes<\/a>&#8230; and you should be proud! Why? You made the decision to serve others with your intellect, talents, and creativity, and no good deed goes unrewarded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Get an estimate for how much your self-employment tax will cost with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.selfemployment-taxcalculator.com\/\">this helpful calculator.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know as a freelancer you are taxed as an employer even if you do not have employees? If you receive a W2 as an employee and you earn income from side gigs, you are double taxed\u2014you pay taxes on your freelance income and taxes on the income you earn as a W2 employee.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if that bit of information is news to you or it sounds confusing, no need to fear, but I\u2019d strongly recommend checking out the Fiverr Workspace integration with Visor. Visor is a tax firm that specializes in preparing tax returns for people like you and me\u2014freelancers,&nbsp;solopreneurs, and others who make their own hours doing what they love. Also included in this group of independent contractors are social-media-preneurs, Uber drivers and Door Dashers dashing through the snow delivering tasty eats to, guess who? Hard-working freelancers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The benefits of using a tax professional<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Quarterly tax payments<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn income that is not subject to withholding, the IRS requires you to pay an estimated quarterly tax payment, due on April 15, June 15, September 15 and January 15.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, many tax professionals encourage their clients to set aside a monthly tax payment for ease in handling the tax payment. Making one huge payment when you file your taxes at the end of the year could result in major heartache, to say the least.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. Not sure how much to pay?<\/strong> <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Visor\u2019s tax professionals are skilled at calculating the amount you should set aside for each estimated quarterly payment based on your net income and the government-regulated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes\">self-employment tax of 15.3%.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3. Protect yourself from an IRS Audit<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve never been audited by the IRS, you\u2019ve probably heard numerous horror stories from those who have. It can be a highly stressful event even if you\u2019ve been through it before. No worries. Visor\u2019s tax professionals know how to prepare for an IRS audit and how to present your documentation, and they offer free audit protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>4. More tax deductions<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Which operating costs can you deduct on your 2018 tax return? Can you write off a portion of your home office, utilities, advertising, meals, and rent? These are common questions that freelancers often ask and rightfully so.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could be forfeiting hundreds and possibly thousands in <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/commonly-missed-tax-deductible-expenses-for-your-home-office\/\">government-approved deductions<\/a> if you\u2019re ill-advised. Thankfully, Visor excels in many areas of tax law and business deductions are no exception. A Visor tax advisor will make sure you\u2019re taking advantage of all of the tax write-offs available to you as a self-employed individual.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>5. Stay on top of new tax laws&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Tax laws are always changing and unless you are a tax professional, deciphering the tax language may be more than challenging. <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tax-changes-freelancers-llc-s-corp\/\">This article sheds some clarity<\/a>&nbsp;on the new IRS pass-through deduction. But to get full clarity on this new law and how it impacts your specific filingstatus, a Visor tax advisor can present the tax law in layman\u2019s terms toeliminate the fog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Visor you have a full team of experts at your disposal tomake sure all of the Ts are crossed and every I is dotted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>File your 2018 tax return and<\/strong>&nbsp;relax<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting started is super easy.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Firstly, to receive the deep discount we\u2019ve reserved for Fiverr Workspace from Fiverr members, be sure to sign up for Visor support from your Fiverr Workspace account.
