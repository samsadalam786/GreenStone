It is a personal choice and many factors contribute to the decision. Some slide right back into a full-time job after a quick couple of days. Other parents, if they have the financial freedom, may choose instead to embark on a new career as a stay at home parent.<br \/>\nSome countries, like my home country of Canada, allow one parent to stay at home with their newborn for a year, which is awesome. Other countries do not offer progressive policies.<br \/>\nThere are also many educated professionals with great work experience who decide to completely opt out of the workforce upon becoming a parent. The reasons vary, but often include poor access to child care or tax disincentives. They often still wish they could participate in the workforce to help their family financially. Until now it has been very difficult for these moms to easily find flexible work.<\/p>\n<h3>Going back to work has its challenges<\/h3>\n<p>Regardless of when or how you decide to go back to work, going back to work is NEVER easy. You now have someone else to think and worry about. Depending on the age of your children you need to consider reliable child care options such as the help of a family member, a nanny (could be expensive) or day care (limited hours).<br \/>\nThe stress between splitting time between a career and family is a juggling act. Many parents worry about how they will be able to stay home if their child is sick? Can they participate and attend school activities? Or if they will even have time to get groceries, have the laundry done or get a meal on the table?<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fpart-time-freelance-work-can-benefit-new-parents%2F&#038;text=The%20stress%20between%20splitting%20time%20between%20a%20%23career%20and%20%23family%20is%20a%20juggling%20act.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The stress between splitting time between a #career and #family is a juggling act. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fpart-time-freelance-work-can-benefit-new-parents%2F&#038;text=The%20stress%20between%20splitting%20time%20between%20a%20%23career%20and%20%23family%20is%20a%20juggling%20act.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Flexibility is key in your new life<\/h3>\n<p>Flexible work is a solution to this growing problem of work\/life conflicts.
