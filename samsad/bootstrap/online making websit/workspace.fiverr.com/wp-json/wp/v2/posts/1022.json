We\u2019ve got the solutions to help keep the ghouls at bay and get you to that party!<\/p>\n<h2>When Bigfoot Attacks!<\/h2>\n<p>The nightmare that every Freelancer dreads; losing your biggest client. This can be even more terrifying if they are responsible for 90% of your income. Before you start running through the forest screaming \u2018why me?!\u2019, turn this nightmare into a learning experience. Don\u2019t base too much of your income on just one client. Take on a variety of clients, big and small, to help spread the responsibility.<\/p>\n<h2>No One Can Hear You Scream!<\/h2>\n<p>Losing your Wi-Fi connection can be terrifying. It can make you feel like you\u2019re all alone at a lake-house, with no&nbsp;power, and some<em>thing<\/em> just untied the boat from the dock; you can\u2019t reach anyone, and you have no idea if you&#8217;ll&nbsp;survive the night. Stay calm, we\u2019re here to help. Did you know that most smart phones have the ability to act as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/article2\/0,2817,2481374,00.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HotSpot<\/a>? You can use your phone\u2019s 3G to create a Wi-Fi hub and connect your computer to the signal. This can be super useful if you\u2019re at your local cafe and they\u2019re having unexpected problems with their connection!<\/p>\n<h2>The Attack of the 50ft Freelance Tax Payment<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s nothing worse than being surprised by a large, unexpected bill.

Easy!<\/p>\n<h2>The Freelance Twilight (Time) Zone<\/h2>\n<p>For those freelancers who have clients all over the world, it can to tricky to schedule calls and make sure everyone&#8217;s on the same page. It&#8217;s even harder&nbsp;when <em>you&#8217;re<\/em>&nbsp;traveling, especially if you didn&#8217;t write down whether the meeting was PST or EST before you left. <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/scary-the-exorcist-movie-T5D3cMOARTEbu\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Don&#8217;t panic!<\/a> Exorcise those demons with the&nbsp;help of your computer calendar! Most calendars have a location setting that automatically updates the times depending on your location. Make sure the location setting is switched on, and catch that plane!<\/p>\n<h2>The Case of the Missing Time Stamp<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re one of those superstar freelancers who charges&nbsp;by the minute and sets a timer for each project, you\u2019ll understand the horror of by mistake resetting the clock before you had the chance to write down the time! Keeping track of the minutes you\u2019ve spent on different clients throughout the day can be exhausting and complicated.

Case closed!<\/p>\n<h2>Forgetful Frankenstein<\/h2>\n<p>We all know how hard it can be to keep on top of a simple to-do list when you\u2019ve got appointments, conference calls, personal errands <i>and <\/i>last minute client requests to deal with. This busy schedule might cause you to suddenly wake up at 2am&nbsp;in a cold sweat because you forgot to respond to the&nbsp;text message your&nbsp;client sent in the middle of the day!&nbsp;Avoid these bloody curdling moments by using apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/web.any.do\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Any.Do<\/a>, an easy-to-use list app that makes it super simple to jot down last minute items on the run!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s close to midnight\u2026 and you\u2019re sitting at your desk designing a logo for a client&#8217;s&nbsp;new startup.
