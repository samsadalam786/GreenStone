Instead, your mind is focused on an immediate sense of validation.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The naysayers aside, you\u2019ll have family, friends, and professional contacts all congratulating you on the leap in one way or another.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cGood for you!\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cHow brave.

Starting out on your own\u2014whether its your main focus or a side hustle\u2014requires its fair share of logistical and mental preparation.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you do what you love, you\u2019ll likely challenge yourself in ways you never have before. Some days may feel like a hustle. Some days may feel like a grind.

First thing\u2019s first, you have to get paid.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s something that, after working a traditional 9 to 5, many first-time freelance writers take for granted. And fail to prepare for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting Paid as a Freelancer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, you\u2019re likely wearing not just many, but <em>all<\/em> the hats. This includes that of Chief Financial Officer.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More broadly speaking, it\u2019ll work in your favor to think through how to <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2019\/10\/01\/how-to-take-care-of-bookkeeping-efficiently\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"handle your bookkeeping efficiently (opens in a new tab)\">handle your bookkeeping efficiently<\/a> sooner rather than later. Keeping track of your finances is something that can easily fall through the cracks and cause unwanted issues down the road.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the world of freelance writing especially, you\u2019ll find that the more attention you pay to the numbers, the easier it\u2019ll be to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-much-should-i-charge-for-my-services-how-to-set-your-rates-as-a-freelancer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"set your rates (opens in a new tab)\">set your rates<\/a>. You can be confident knowing what you\u2019re charging factors in expenses, taxes, and available resources accordingly.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to finding consistent freelance writing work, closing deals, and making good on promised deliverables\u2014you\u2019ll also need to master a process for receiving compensation <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/8-skills-to-master-your-first-30-days-freelancer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"within your first 30 days (opens in a new tab)\">within your first 30 days<\/a>.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means learning how to write and send an invoice to clients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dig deeper into how to invoice for freelance writers:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Create an Invoice Template for Freelance Writers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing about freelancing nowadays is the volume of resources available to learn from. You don\u2019t have to reinvent the invoicing wheel.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you do have to do is invest the time and effort to create a process that works for <em>you<\/em>. The good news: once you\u2019ve created a workable invoice template for your freelance writing, you can recycle it across all future projects sold.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started, decide on a tool to use in creating your invoice template.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to start from scratch with a basic tool like Google Docs, consider how it\u2019ll factor into the invoicing process in its entirety. Since it\u2019s not connected to any other systems, using this bare bones approach may result in many manual hours of your time spent downloading, generating emails, following up, receiving payment, and so on.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can opt to use a <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"free invoicing software (opens in a new tab)\">free invoicing software<\/a> that helps streamline the process from sent to paid. The benefit of a smart invoicing app is efficiency\u2014it allows you to create invoices automatically and stay in the know with triggered alerts.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the easier your invoicing process, the easier it is to get <em>paid<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Importance of Invoicing<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re freelance writing, you\u2019re running a business. Realize that if you don\u2019t take the necessary steps in protecting your time, effort, and work\u2014no one else will.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the beginning, it\u2019s easy to be blinded by the aforementioned validation and self-motivation high. Especially when you book that first client.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a party of one up against larger corporations, you may be more apt to bend to their prescribed way of doing things or foregoing your chosen process. While there\u2019s a time and place for being flexible, don\u2019t think of your payment terms as one of them.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll likely have to negotiate on pricing initially, as you build out a client base. But <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2019\/09\/26\/net-90-payment-is-a-policy-that-freelancers-cant-afford\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"net 90 payment terms (opens in a new tab)\">net 90 payment terms<\/a> and a handshake agreement will never work in your favor.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, why should you be expected to extend credit to an enterprise organization?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invoicing is a means of keeping your payments on schedule, yes. But it\u2019s also important for you and your clients\u2019 records. Their finance team will benefit from the documentation come tax time, as will you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What to Include on Your Invoice Template<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you\u2019re building out an invoice for freelance writing, don\u2019t overcomplicate things. Unlike your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-build-a-freelance-website-that-gets-you-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"website (opens in a new tab)\">website<\/a>, things like look and feel shouldn\u2019t be a main concern.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a logo, feel free to insert it in the header area for brand consistency. But don\u2019t overdo it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your client\u2019s finance team is really only concerned that it looks professional and includes all of the information they need to record and match payments.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the size of the company you\u2019re writing for, you may also end up having to submit invoices into an automated payment processing system like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Tipalti (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/tipalti.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tipalti<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bill.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Bill.com (opens in a new tab)\">Bill.com<\/a>. In these cases, there may be specific formatting needs to ensure an invoice is submitted successfully.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not though, you\u2019ll cover your bases with an invoice template that includes the following.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Your Contact Information<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>On every freelance writing invoice you send, don\u2019t forget to include who should be getting paid\u2014<em>you<\/em>. If your client goes the route of mailing checks, this will give them access to your most up-to-date billing address.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Format it to include your business\u2019 name and mailing address. You can also include your website address, email, and phone number to provide additional ways for them to contact you.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Example:<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flyingbird Social Media<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>401 West Broadway<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Suite 430<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New York, NY 10013<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>United States<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>www.flyingbird.com<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Your Client\u2019s Information<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to leave space for your client\u2019s contact information on your freelance writing invoice template, as well.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help from a records standpoint. If you ever have to cross-reference or follow up on payments down the road, you\u2019ll save time with all of the information needed living in one document. For US-based freelancers working with international clients, oftentimes, including the client\u2019s contact information is necessary for compliance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both you and your client\u2019s information can be left-aligned on your invoice. Or you can format them on opposite sides of each other in the header.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Dates and Payment Terms<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Every great invoicing process starts with the solid foundation of a contract that clearly outlines your payment process and expectations.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make note of when an invoice is submitted, when it\u2019s due, and your payment terms. If you ever get pushback from a client during a follow-up, you can reference this information as a back-up.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the same vein, if you\u2019re documenting payments in a centralized location, you should be able to track trends across clients over time. As your workload increases, this will help you better determine who\u2019s worth your efforts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>An Invoice Number<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re using an <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"invoicing software (opens in a new tab)\">invoicing software<\/a>, it should automatically generate these numbers with every new invoice created. If you\u2019re not, create a system\u2014with numbering starting at 001, 1001, or whatever <em>consistent <\/em>convention you prefer.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is that you have a way of matching records back to each other as invoices are sent and paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Itemized Deliverables (with Descriptions)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How you map out deliverables may change based on client preferences. For the sake of your freelance writer invoice template, however, you\u2019ll want to list items around project type.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you were contracted for two blogs and one white paper, list them as two separate line items. Include relevant details like word count and titles as desired.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pricing and Hours<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How you document work performed will depend on whether your agreement with a client is based on hourly or flat fees. Take note of the number of hours worked or pieces created to help in calculating final costs accurately\u2014and ensure you get paid what you\u2019re due.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can align your time spent or the number of deliverables produced with a corresponding price.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re working with an invoicing system that also <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"accepts payments (opens in a new tab)\">accepts payments<\/a>, options for how to pay should generate automatically alongside your invoice template. This simplifies things for your clients, which usually translates to more money in the bank for you <em>on time<\/em>.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/free-invoice-templates\"><strong><em>Download invoice templates to customize for your freelance writing business.<\/em><\/strong><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sending Your Invoice to a Client<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With your freelance writing invoice template all laid out, you\u2019re ready to start requesting those dollars and cents.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure every invoice you send is accompanied with a personalized note. This is crucial for the sake of relationship-building and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/4-keys-to-retaining-clients-as-a-freelancer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"retaining clients (opens in a new tab)\">retaining clients<\/a> for the long-term.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the subject line of your email, make reference to your business\u2019 name and the invoice number. Then attach your invoice. Make sure it\u2019s saved as a PDF so it can\u2019t be easily altered on their end.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the body of your email, keep the tone short, sweet, and above all else\u2014thankful.
