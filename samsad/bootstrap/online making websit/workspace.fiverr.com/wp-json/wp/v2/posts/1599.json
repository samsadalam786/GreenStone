This week, we\u2019re going to look at similar locations for people in the design and graphics community.\u00a0There are quite a few groups and avenues you can go down when developing your online community. <\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few to kick start your journey:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design Portfolio Communities<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designdb.co\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/DesignDB-banner-blogpost-1.jpg\" alt=\"Design Portfolio Communities\" class=\"wp-image-5781\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are some places that can seem like a freelance community but are mostly fall off after a few comments and likes.Some of these do provide places for freelancers to network behind the scenes, but that\u2019s not the primary purpose of a portfolio site.&nbsp;So, be sure to pick out the right community for you. <\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are quite a few options out there and you can find yours on the web and your phone.&nbsp;<\/span>Most portfolio sites also have a job board or some way for clients to reach out to freelancers for hire. So, while they provide benefits you should explore, be cautious if you go this route as your prime choice for a community. Remember, what we\u2019re looking for are places where freelancers can talk with other freelancers.<br>But be sure to start your exploration off on the big names like <a href=\"https:\/\/behance.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Behance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dribbble<\/a> are excellent places to start as a way of showcasing your work and connecting with other creators.&nbsp;Others like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coroflot.com\/designsalaryguide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coroflot<\/a>&nbsp;will provide you insights into salaries and jobs a bit more than communal interaction. Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.deviantart.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Deviant Art<\/a> touts itself as the largest online gallery and art community. If you&#8217;re having trouble determining what community is best for you, research the best practices and preferences are of the community.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Graphic Design Forums<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s probably no surprise that when a graphic designer wants to get away, they don\u2019t want to be surrounded by graphics. There is still one older online era\u00a0forum\u00a0that is quite active and respected in the designer community, aptly named\u00a0<\/span>Graphic Design Forum.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like with any old-style forum, you\u2019ll need to lurk for a while to understand how the group works. Still, these are great places to get your feet wet and commiserate. Both are still quite active. Sadly, there are also references to many other forums that have since died out all over the web. So it goes with older styles of communication.<\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then again, there is one modern site that is a forum of forums: Reddit. Reddit has a graphic design community with just over 100,000 subscribers. You can find it at: <\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/graphic_design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reddit&#8217;s graphic design subreddit<\/a>. Look on their sidebar for a plethora of related subreddits that can help you find just the right niche of designers that match your own style. Fair warning, though! If you\u2019ve never used Reddit, you may find yourself spending more time reading posts and commenting than doing design work.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slack for Designers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, Slack comes to the fore as the place for freelancers to commiserate. Slack has very strong freelance communities and much stronger protections than a traditional forum. Often you\u2019ll have to jump through a few hoops to prove you\u2019re a member of the community instead of a spammer or someone looking to post a job. Here are the Slack groups to look for as a graphics designer. Note that some of these links lead to signup forms:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.designerhangout.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Designer Hangout<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.launch-chat.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#Launch<\/a>&nbsp;(Not just for designers)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Design Talks (<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSeKT_LC8kKTzJ4JjmgVQVpfl24i1qBkjJ7TYyQcNHL7fBQkYQ\/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1\">Sign up at this Google Doc link<\/a>)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.deardesigners.co\/\">Dear Designers<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/hashtagmotiondesign.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#MotionDesign<\/a>&nbsp;(for animators)<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Spec&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/robinraszka.typeform.com\/to\/biXsKB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pttrns<\/a><\/strong><\/li><li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/teamsketch.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Team Sketch<\/a><\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of the developer sites also overlap with design, especially for front-end development. If the designs of website and mobile interfaces interest you, head back to our developer articles and look for forums devoted to front-end development, as well as UI\/UX.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Facebook for Designers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook falls short for most freelancing communities. Why? They\u2019re too easily infiltrated by people who want to get business or look for a freelancer rather than talking shop. And those that do have quality are often private groups that you can\u2019t find with a normal search. A good place to start, however, is to find closed groups on Facebook related to your niche, and there are a few open ones worth your time. For designers, here are a few potential candidates:<\/span><br><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/grafix.design\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Graphic Designers]<\/span><\/a><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/DesignGoTo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DesignGoTo<\/a><\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And well, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/6215481930\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Graphic Design<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Professional Design Organizations<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Design is an old discipline, so there are many professional organizations out there for different design niches. Probably the most respected one is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aiga.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AIGA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the American Institute of Graphic Arts. But there are many others. In the interests of space, we\u2019ll refer you to this <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/guides.library.ucla.edu\/c.php?g=180300&amp;p=1186802\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">list of professional design organizations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> created by UCLA. Another idea is to seek out a mentor. While not exactly a community, you can work with them to network further into the community. In doing so, you&#8217;ll be building a community a bit more like the older era designers had to.&nbsp;<\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We hope that within this article you\u2019ll find a community that\u2019s perfect for your design niche.
