Unless you have productized your services, you\u2019re literally selling your time. It&#8217;s a scarce resource worth monitoring closely.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The more aware you are about what you are spending time on, the more efficiently you can manage your time and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-time-tracking-can-make-you-a-more-productive-freelancer\/\">boost your productivity.<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nRead on to find out how time tracking can help you make more informed business decisions, become a more powerful negotiator, and build better client relationships. Plus, how you can use <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s time tracking app<\/a>\u00a0to your advantage.<\/p>\n<h3>How time tracking can improve your freelance business<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5982\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/AND-CO-time-tracking-1-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"299\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>Smarter freelance business decisions.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proper and consistent <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">time tracking<\/a> enables you to make informed business decisions.\u00a0It allows you to come up with more accurate estimates, budgets\u00a0and\u00a0deadlines. Setting the right expectations before starting a project potentially saves you a lot of frustration and painful discussions about exceeded budgets and missed deadlines along the way. If you can identify tasks that eat up a bunch of your time, you can focus on optimizing or eliminating those. Or put a bigger price tag on them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Time tracking makes freelancers happier. Seriously.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe me. It does. Time tracking forces you to reflect on your day&#8217;s work and look at what you have achieved. Constantly tracking your progress and celebrating the small wins on a daily or weekly basis is key to maintaining a healthy mind, staying self-motivated and relieving stress. That is especially important for freelancers who work remotely and naturally lack frequent performance reviews. And as a positive side effect, you\u2019ll become a more confident negotiator when it\u2019s time to talk money.<\/span><br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fintroducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity%2F&#038;text=Ever%20thought%20about%20how%20%23TimeTracking%20could%20help%20you%20become%20a%20more%20confident%20negotiator%20when%20it%20comes%20time%20for%20performance%20reviews%3F%20Find%20out%20here.%20%23Freelance&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ever thought about how #TimeTracking could help you become a more confident negotiator when it comes time for performance reviews?

Your client needs to know what you are charging for. But no matter if your clients require you to report time or not, successful freelancers know that being transparent about the activities you are charging for builds trust and helps you establish long lasting, prospering relationships with your clients.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Monitoring your performance.<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you don\u2019t want to share your timesheets with clients, time tracking is a great tool to monitor your performance. Think a certain task is super quick and easy to do? Now you&#8217;ll know for sure how long it usually takes. Did some task take you 2 hours last week but 5 this week? You can begin to analyze why and make plans to increase your efficiency.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-time-tracking-can-make-you-a-more-productive-freelancer\/\">5 Ways Time Tracking Can Make You a More Productive Freelancer<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Free time tracking for everyone<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">Fiverr Workspace\u2019s free time tracking feature<\/a> gives you all the utility of a common standalone app, but seamlessly integrates with your invoicing and projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Time tracking every second<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our built-in timer lets you track hours in real time and easily add them to your timesheet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5975\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/AND-CO-time-sheets-time-tracking-1.jpg\" alt=\"Fiverr Workspace time sheets time tracking\" width=\"354\" height=\"322\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4>Designed for busy freelance professionals<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timers are automatically created for each of your running or upcoming projects.
