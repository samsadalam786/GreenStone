Wake up whenever you want. Work from home and make good money. Maybe only go into an office once a month or so to talk with a client. Your own schedule! It sounds great, and it is great, but it\u2019s not all sunshine and roses either.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Many freelancers come to the harsh realization that if they don\u2019t manage their time well they won\u2019t make enough money to keep the dream alive. It takes time to hunt new clients, do taxes, market yourself, and still do the dream job you want to do. Will you still be stuck with having to work eight hours, or ten or even twelve, to keep a roof over your head?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are a lot of factors that go into that question. Yes, in the beginning, you may have to work harder than you ever did in your office just to get the business started. Your job may just take a lot of time compared to others. The keys to successful time management as a freelancer can be broken down into two core ideas.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Make sure that you are earning enough from your billable hours that you can support yourself and have the time off you desire.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compartmentalize your time ruthlessly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Billable Freelance Work Hours<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One of the benefits that employees actually get is a guaranteed wage. Whether you work hourly or for a salary, your employer has to give you that money if you do your job. Freelancers don\u2019t have that assurance, so they must build their client base to make it happen.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Building a client base takes time and you\u2019re not getting paid for it. These are non-billable hours. Billable hours are any portion of time when you\u2019re doing something you\u2019ll get paid for. Tracking down a new client and negotiating a contract with them is non-billable. Actually writing the piece\/doing the design\/making the web page is billable. Billable plus non-billable hours make up your working hours.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your goal is not to maximize your billable hours. It\u2019s to find the right proportion of billable hours and non-billable hours to do all the tasks necessary. It\u2019s a little like mixing gas and air in a carburetor. You need just the right mix to keep the engine running.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some things that fall under non-billable hours:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marketing and sales<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Hunting for new clients<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Negotiating with clients<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">General office work<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Talking with your accountant or lawyer<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Working with other contractors for larger jobs<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Basically, anything that isn\u2019t directly earning you money. You need to do enough activity in your non-billable time to earn you enough billable hours at a rate that brings in enough money to meet your needs. This is the fundamental goal of every freelancer.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But what about all that free time? Well, that has to be factored in too. Some freelancers fail to work too few working hours, or spend too much time on non-billable activities, and end up not earning enough cash. Others work way too hard and find their homes, their health, and their mental state deteriorating from the stress. Hard work may be a virtue of entrepreneurs but it must also be smart work.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You must force yourself away from your work to recharge, and we don\u2019t mean sleep. You\u2019ll need to factor in vacation time, sick days, and holidays. You\u2019ll also need to have daily time to do things like take care of yourself and your house. You don\u2019t want code enforcement knocking on your because you haven\u2019t mowed your lawn for a month due to all the work you\u2019ve been doing!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The ratios between billable and non-billable hours, as well as work and non-work hours, will change over time. Sometimes work dries up and you have to work more, or something comes up and you need to work less. It\u2019s a constant juggling act.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Compartmentalization &#8212; A Freelancer Must-Have<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Another thing all freelancers have to learn is that they have the control over their time. But there are many things that try to suck our time away. Paradoxically, you may find that you have to keep an even stricter schedule than you did as an employee just to keep up. It doesn\u2019t have to be a harsh one, but it must have strong boundaries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freelancers that fail to learn how to compartmentalize their time will end up making clients angry. By compartmentalization, we mean dividing your time into chunks where you work on a specific activity or project and nothing else. Contrary to popular belief, multi-tasking does not lead to maximum productivity. If you\u2019re working on several closely related tasks, perhaps, but freelancers don\u2019t work on closely-related tasks. Each client job is different. Imagine if you had to write 6 articles by a deadline and you jumped to a different random one every time you finished a paragraph. You\u2019d never get done. The brain\u2019s gearbox would grind to a halt.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Compartmentalization starts by learning your limits. Everyone has limits to how long they can perform an activity before the quality of the work starts to decline. If you know that you can write two hours straight with no problems but a third will mean more time editing later, that\u2019s a limit that must be respected. Since you are responsible for the entire quality of your business, you must respect your capabilities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Some people prefer to work in large chunks. One person\u2019s work day may look like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Half hour email<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 hour working with client A<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">2 hours working with client B<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 hour lunch<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 hour hunting clients<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">1 hour working with client C<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Half hour email<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s six hours of work, four of which are billable, and an hour for lunch. Some people don\u2019t like working straight like this and need to break up their time. For instance, they may prefer to work 20 minutes and then take a 10 minute break, or work 45 minutes and take a 15 minute break. Which way works best depends completely on how you work best. You\u2019ll need to experiment.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What breaks these compartments down? Two main reasons. One is the everyday distractions that plague us all. People in the office might goof off on Facebook, but working from home adds a whole new layer of distractions. You have to build the discipline to say that this time is for this activity and this alone. Some people use programs like StayFocusd and Leechblock to stop themselves from visiting time-wasting sites.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The other one is your clients. Some clients will try to get as much work out of you as possible. The polite ones will keep asking for just one more thing and blow out your timetable. It\u2019s great if they\u2019re willing to pay and it won\u2019t interfere with your other clients. The rude ones will try to treat you like an employee and expect that you\u2019ll be at their beck and call, or try to hide such a relationship inside a complicated contract. Freelancing will teach you how to put your foot down and declare your independence.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just like when you go to a mechanic and they say it\u2019s going to take several hours and a long wait on top, you need to be comfortable saying the same thing to your clients. A client is not a boss. It is a temporary partnership where you trade money for your skills as equals. This is why freelancers are very keen on using contracts, and why you should use them as well.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can find a lot of time management tips by browsing the net, but managing your time as a freelancer requires an approach that\u2019s different from the usual. It\u2019s not just a matter of raising productivity. It\u2019s about finding an overall balance in your business and with your life so that your dream job can stay sustainable for the long term. If you find that you\u2019ve hit a good balance but you\u2019re not making enough money, then it\u2019s time to raise your rates.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you remember working in a cubicle, or if you work in one now, you might have dreamed about what it would be like to work<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":38,"featured_media":7634,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Getting Your Schedule Under Control As a Freelancer<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Your freelance job may just take a lot of time compared to others.
