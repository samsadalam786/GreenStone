In fact, some of the most innovative and groundbreaking artists, inventors and entrepreneurs of the modern age have slipped away to work remotely.<br \/>\nThe result: beautiful, inspiring and one-of-a-kind creative works born in unlikely places. These famous artists can serve as inspiration to us all when it comes to the benefits of a remote work lifestyle.<\/p>\n<h3>1. George Harrison in\u00a0India<\/h3>\n<p>While still a member of the Beatles, George Harrison became intrigued with Indian culture and more specifically, Hinduism. In 1966, he ventured to India, where he met Ravi Shankar and asked for sitar lessons. The meeting was the beginning of a long-term collaboration.<br \/>\nIn the Martin Scorsese documentary \u201cLiving in the Material World,\u201d George\u2019s wife Olivia says that his life was \u201ctransformed by India.\u201d The visit influenced his <a href=\"https:\/\/pitchfork.com\/reviews\/albums\/22037-all-things-must-pass\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">first-ever solo album<\/a>, \u201cAll Things Must Pass.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>2. Ernest Hemingway in Cuba<\/h3>\n<p>Storied American author Ernest Hemingway was raised in Illinois but would later live in Paris, Florida, and Cuba. He spent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smithsonianmag.com\/travel\/hemingways-cuba-cubas-hemingway-159858952\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most of his creative life<\/a> in and around Havana and referenced his two favorite watering\u00a0in a famous quote:\u00a0<em>Mi mojito en La Bodeguita mi daiquiri in El Floridita.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>3. Dave Chappelle in South Africa<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes you just need to get away to clear your head. Comedian Dave Chappelle famously booked a flight to South Africa in 2005 to escape the public spotlight. The move shocked fans as he walked away from his hit TV show, &#8220;Chappelle&#8217;s Show&#8221; on Comedy Central, at its peak. He would later tell Oprah that he left because he was &#8220;incredibly stressed out.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>4. J.K. Rowling on the Commute<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s said that Rowling came up with the concept for Harry Potter <a href=\"https:\/\/ejournals.bc.edu\/ojs\/index.php\/freshink\/article\/view\/1230\/1588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">while riding a train<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Emily Dickinson while WFH<\/h3>\n<p>Remote work can sometimes mean locking yourself in your house for a few hours to get things done. Take it from Emily Dickinson, the famed American poet who\u00a0stayed on her family property for\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/content.time.com\/time\/specials\/packages\/article\/0,28804,1902376_1902378_1902436,00.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">twenty years<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h3>6. Jonathan Franzen in Chile<\/h3>\n<p>Following the passing of close friend David Foster Wallace in 2011, American novelist Jonathan Franzen (&#8220;Purity,&#8221; &#8220;The Corrections,&#8221; and &#8220;Freedom&#8221;) ventured to a remote island in Chile to mourn, and birdwatch. Following his trip, he penned a\u00a0beautiful and self-reflective essay for <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/magazine\/2011\/04\/18\/farther-away-jonathan-franzen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The New Yorker<\/a><\/em> that chronicled his experience in isolation.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Vladimir Nabokov in the Southwest U.S.<\/h3>\n<p>Vladimir Nabokov wrote his most famous work, &#8220;Lolita,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.bookstellyouwhy.com\/how-nabokov-wrote-his-masterpiece-lolita\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">following a series of road trips<\/a> across the U.S. His journeys took him all over the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2016\/05\/29\/travel\/vladimir-nabokov-lolita.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">American West<\/a>, from New Jersey to the Rocky Mountains.<\/p>\n<h3>8. TONS of people at Muscle Shoals<\/h3>\n<p>In the 1960s, a tiny studio in Sheffield, Ala.\u00a0grew to international prominence as artists lined up to get the &#8220;Muscle Shoals&#8221; sound \u00a0on their albums. What began as the birthplace of soul classics like Percy Sledge&#8217;s &#8220;When a Man Loves a Woman,&#8221; over time expanded to attract the likes of rock musicians like Fleetwood Mac and the Rolling Stones. Songs <a href=\"https:\/\/www.al.com\/entertainment\/index.ssf\/2016\/12\/the_20_best_songs_ever_recorde.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recorded there<\/a> include &#8220;Brown Sugar&#8221; (Rolling Stones), &#8220;Slip Away&#8221; (Clarence Carter) and &#8220;Mustang Sally&#8221; (Wilson Pickett).<\/p>\n<h3>9. Bruce Springsteen on the Jersey Shore<\/h3>\n<p>When Springsteen the East Street Band reunited to record &#8220;Darkness on the Edge of Town,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/music\/2010\/sep\/23\/bruce-springsteen-darkness-edge-town\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">legal troubles exiled the artist from his studio<\/a> and so the band was forced to rehearse at his Jersey Shore home. Footage from the recording sessions reveal how the close quarters contributed to intense collaboration, resulting in some of the band&#8217;s most critically acclaimed work. In all, the band would record 70 songs, which would later be cut down to ten tracks.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Nikola Tesla in Colorado Springs<\/h3>\n<p>The Serbian-American inventor Nikola Tesla, credited for his pioneering work in electricity, set up an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pbs.org\/tesla\/ll\/ll_colspr.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">experimental station<\/a> in Colorado Springs, Colo. in 1899. Holed up in a lab during the day and at local hotel at night, he conducted experiments for nine months with the Rocky Mountain skyline as his backdrop.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Have you done of some of your best work remotely?
