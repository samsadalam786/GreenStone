Right?<\/span><br \/>\nNot exactly.<\/p>\n<h2>The Realities of Working From Home<\/h2>\n<p>The best part about being self-employed is that you get to work wherever and whenever you want. In fact, this is likely why you made the switch in the first place: the flexibility of choosing your own schedule and work environment.<br \/>\nAnd if you\u2019re just starting out as a freelancer, chances are you chose to work from home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But the truth is, once you\u2019ve <\/span><i style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">actually<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> started working from home, you might notice that you are not as productive as you were before. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone that has been \u201cworking from home\u201d full time for the past four years, here are four common scenarios that I\u2019ve faced:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Distractions are everywhere. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because we\u2019re so easily distracted nowadays (e.g. browsing the web, responding to texts on your smartphone, etc), your attention is constantly pulled in different directions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Can\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to friends and family. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s a misunderstanding of how free and flexible you really are for your work schedule when they want to spend time with you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Lack of focus on the right things<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procrastinating on tasks that feel important and urgent, but aren\u2019t actually important.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Experiencing cabin fever<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Entrepreneurship can get lonely and it doesn&#8217;t help if you&#8217;re always working at home by yourself.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can relate to any of these points, don\u2019t fret. I\u2019ll show you my best strategies below for dealing with these challenges. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pro Tip 1: Fight Self-Imposed Distractions<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever found yourself working on something, only to realize that you\u2019ve somehow spent <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the last two hours reading Reddit, Facebook, and Wikipedia<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? The good news is, you\u2019re not alone. The bad news is, the lack of focus and self-awareness can really kill your business<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not just <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\/\">your productivity<\/a>.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To combat this, I use tools such as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/dayboard.co\/?ref=andco\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dayboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/stayfocusd\/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">StayFocusd<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forestapp.cc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forest<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to drastically cut down my amount of distracted browsing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Dayboard\u2019s<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Chrome extension replaces your new tab page with your five most important tasks to remind you of what you\u2019re working on before you browse the web. If that\u2019s not enough, their Focus Mode shows you one task at a time, and their Refocus Tab gives you reminders directly on distracting or feels-like-work-but-not-really sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>StayFocusd<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is also a productivity extension for Google Chrome that helps you stay focused on work by restricting the amount of time you can spend on time-wasting websites. Once your allotted time has been used up, the sites you block will be inaccessible for the rest of the day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Forest<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a mobile app that aims to prevent you from impulsively check your phone. You can \u201cplant a seed\u201d in Forest to start a focus period based on a time you set. As time passes, the seed will gradually grow into a tree. But if you check your phone before the time is up, your tree will wither away.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pro tip 2: Say \u201cNO\u201d to friends and family<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you work from home and set your own schedule, it\u2019s easy for your friends and family to think you\u2019re \u201cfree\u201d throughout the day. While this is sometimes okay, you need to set boundaries in order to get the same amount of working hours as a 9 to 5 (or however many hours you choose to work). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s how I\u2019ve strategically said \u201cno\u201d to my family and friends:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><b>Have an honest talk. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let them know the reality of being self-employed (e.g. not working means not getting paid). This will give them a better understanding of where you\u2019re coming from.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Pick days out of the week and stick to it. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to spend time with friends and family, and by pointing out specific days to hang out (and which days for work), you\u2019ve automatically said \u201cno\u201d to for all your regular workdays.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><b>Don\u2019t be afraid to just say \u201cno\u201d.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you followed points 1 and 2 and it\u2019s your day off, just let them know when you need time to yourself or have other plans.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The key takeaway here is to make sure you can protect your day with valuable time to complete the work you need to do, but be empathetic and respectful at the same time.<\/p>\n<h2>Pro tip 3: Focus On The Right Tasks<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Distractions are lethal to entrepreneurs, but lack of focus on the right tasks would second that. \u00a0Ever had a long workday, but all you\u2019ve done is repetitively checked your email, planned out your week, or read a bunch of articles? Unless you work in customer support or sales, you really shouldn\u2019t be looking at your inbox that often.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I call this positive procrastination (or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/01\/15\/science\/positive-procrastination-not-an-oxymoron.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">structured procrastination<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) &#8212; when you\u2019re misled by busy work and don\u2019t get around to the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">real<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work. If you struggle with this, here are some strategies you can consider:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><b>Prioritize your tasks. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Review your to-do list and pick 3-5 tasks that would make the most impact for the day. <\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Break down your tasks. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be strategic and realistic when it comes to writing your tasks. Can you complete it in an hour? If not, you\u2019ll have a hard time starting or completing it at all. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Delegate tasks that are not part of your core business. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of being self-employed means you\u2019ll be both running your business (e.g. marketing, sales, serving customers) and making sure it\u2019s operating smoothly (e.g. invoicing, accounting, and bookkeeping). Learn to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">delegate whenever you can<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">o free up valuable time for work you\u2019re uniquely qualified to do.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For delegating tasks, consider using a tool like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=wfh-hurdles\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiverr Workspace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help you automate back-office operations like invoicing and filing expenses, leaving you to focus on work you\u2019re <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">getting paid for and only <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can do.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pro tip 4: Deal With Cabin Fever<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Later, as you continue your journey of self-employment, your sentiments about working from home might not be what you started out with. Entrepreneurship can be very lonely and it can really lower your motivational state from time to time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But don\u2019t let pajamas and afternoon slumps stop you. Here are two of my favorite tricks you can try:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Switch up your work environment.<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go work from a coffee shop<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or a co-working space<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where you can be surrounded by people who are working just as hard as you. Just make sure you have some headphones with you in case things get too loud.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b style=\"color: #424242; font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\">Dress as if you\u2019re going into the office.<\/b> <a style=\"font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.utstat.utoronto.ca\/reid\/sta2201s\/2012\/labcoatarticle.pdf\">Recent studies<\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have shown that the clothes you wear have a big impact on your motivational level &#8212; a phenomenon called <\/span><i style=\"color: #424242; font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\">enclothed cognition<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2><b>Work from home more effectively<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about making the switch from a 9 to 5, I hope there\u2019s enough here to help you get started. And for those who are already in the self-employed club, I hope you\u2019ve learned a few helpful new tricks.
