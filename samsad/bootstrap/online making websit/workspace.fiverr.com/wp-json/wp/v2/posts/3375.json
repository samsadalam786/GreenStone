Founders. Celebs. Taco trucks\u2014less flashy, more delicious, but you get the vibe. But it\u2019s not all about the moguls, stars and glorious eats. Did you know that roughly <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sxsw.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/05\/SXSW-2016-Demographics.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-fifth<\/a> of SXSW attendees are self-employed?<br \/>\nWith the Freelancer\u2019s Union predicting that 40 percent of the U.S. workforce will be \u201cfreelance\u201d by 2020, we expect the number of free-agents in Austin to continue to rise. I was lucky to be on the ground earlier this month, where I gleaned conference best practices for independent hustlers in particular.<\/p>\n<h3>Wear your entrepreneurialism on your sleeve<\/h3>\n<p>SXSW is a melting pot of professionals across a range of disciplines. Some work at large companies, others are founders, and others are doing their own thing and carving their own career adventure as solopreneurs. Networking is the name of the game at SX (and anywhere, really), but you need to be authentic about it. Be open to meeting people you wouldn\u2019t normally cross paths with, and be genuine in your interest about their own endeavors. You\u2019d be surprised at what you can learn from another freelancer\u2019s journey\u2014missteps, mishaps and all.<\/p>\n<h3>Be humble, be generous<\/h3>\n<p>Most freelancers aren\u2019t splurging for the three-day party crib on Rainey Street during SXSW (that would be cool, though!). Rest-assured, there are ways for you to connect with others and add value without throwing down insane amounts of coin. Share a spare battery, take turns at an outlet or offer to send recap notes from that amazing panel you just witnessed.<\/p>\n<h3>Make your network work for you<\/h3>\n<p>Before attending any industry conference, posting on social media is a great way to figure out who in your network will be there. Better yet, you can reach out to contacts with a personal note to see if they\u2019re attending. Even if they\u2019re not going to be at the conference it\u2019s a good way to show your involvement in the industry, stay top of mind and reignite conversations. And if it turns out they\u2019re not attending, it\u2019s another opportunity to be generous and share what you learned. Plus more karma points.<\/p>\n<h3>Do your homework and mind your follow ups<\/h3>\n<p>Get ahead of industry events by doing your homework. Plan your schedule. Book meetings. Bring essential items. Get the app. For example, within the SXSW app, you can search for prospective clients that may be attending or speaking on a panel. If they\u2019re speaking and you\u2019re at the conference, make it your business to show up early and sit front and center. If not, follow along from home via the panel hashtag. Either way, prepare smart follow up questions to show your interest.<\/p>\n<h3>Capture your connections<\/h3>\n<p>Once you meet someone, be sure to get their contact details to stay in touch. Business cards still run abound at most conferences, but there are high tech ways to get connected as well. At SXSW, I learned about Ping by Wurqs. Ping allows you to easily connect with a single email that includes brief details on \u201cthings you would like to learn about\u201d and \u201cthings you can be helpful with,\u201d adding instant value and memorability to any connection. Ping makes keeping track of who you met much easier than looking through a stack of crumpled cardstock.<\/p>\n<h3>Pick the right sessions for you<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best sessions I attended during the week was as part of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ignitetalks.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ignite<\/a> series. Rather than one speaker or panel, these sessions featured ten independent speakers covering a broad range of topics. Each speaker covered 20 slides that automatically advance every 15 seconds for a total of five minutes on stage. This was the best format for what I was going for, but it might not be the same for you. Review the agenda ahead of time (ahem, see above) and choose your battles wisely.<\/p>\n<h3>Embrace the solo-journey<\/h3>\n<p>It can be intimidating to be on your own at an event like SXSW, but letting people know that you\u2019re flying solo is a great way to encourage others welcome you into their world. I met amazing people in Austin and was able to join in their plans throughout the week. As for those \u201clonely\u201d windows, well, I had the opportunity to skip lines, meet different types of people, grab the last seat at the coffee shop, or make it into a crowded panel, simply because I was one person rather than a massive group. Sometimes one isn\u2019t the loneliest number.<br \/>\nBefore you embark on your next conference, these tips will help keep you in a great mindset, stay on your A game, and have fun too! Plus if you&#8217;re just starting out on this freelance venture, they&#8217;re pretty easy to adopt as best practices and will set a great tone for you and your entreprenurial career.<br \/>\n<em><strong>How do you plan for\u00a0these types of conferences?
