Save Money with 5 Easy Principles"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Now more than ever, saving money and building a nest egg for yourself is important.&nbsp;<br \/>\nHowever, you can&#8217;t plan for the future when there&#8217;s debt piling up in the background. Freelancing and earning a steady income is already hard enough, so don&#8217;t make things even more challenging with poor financial planning.&nbsp;<br \/>\nHere at AND.CO, we want to empower freelancers with the tools they need to keep their finances on point. So, if you&#8217;re having financial trouble, here are 5 easy principles that you can follow to help save money.<br \/>\nHere&#8217;s what you need to know:&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>1. Be Efficient with Your Time<\/h2>\n<p>After all, time is money when you&#8217;re a freelancer, which means <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-budget-your-time-and-attention\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you have to be as efficient as possible <\/a>when it comes to getting work done.&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor instance, if it takes you all day to write a 500-word article that only pays you $100, then you&#8217;re only earning a fraction of what&#8217;s possible. Now, if you can churn out 4-5 articles throughout the day, at $100 a pop, now you&#8217;re making some real money that you can sock away for a rainy day.<br \/>\nThat said, maximize your output by getting as much work done as you can during the day. Once you&#8217;re able to start taking in more than you&#8217;re putting out, that&#8217;s when you can start saving money with other strategies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>2. Create a Monthly Budget for Yourself<\/h2>\n<p>So let&#8217;s say that you&#8217;re pulling in $2,000 a month<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014good for you!<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">However, let&#8217;s also imagine that you spend $1,000 every month on bills and rent. Right off the bat, you&#8217;re already losing half your monthly income, which means anything else you want to buy or need to pay for could leave you in the red if you&#8217;re not careful. At this point, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/budgeting-your-finances-as-a-freelancer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\">creating a monthly budget for yourself<\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"> can really come in handy.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\ninitially, you only need to calculate how much you need to pay for each month, and then what&#8217;s leftover, you can break into smaller chunks and decide on what you want to do with it<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014spend, save, invest, etc.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">Here&#8217;s a quick breakdown of a template you can follow<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014start with what you need to pay for and work your way down to what you can do with what you have remaining:&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have $2,000 coming in each month<\/li>\n<li>$700 goes to rent<\/li>\n<li>$200 for groceries<\/li>\n<li>$150 on a car payment<\/li>\n<li>$100 on credit card bills<\/li>\n<li>$100 on gas<\/li>\n<li>$50 for internet<\/li>\n<li>$50 for your phone bill<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Now, you have $650 left to do with what you want each month. And who knows<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014one month you could book more jobs and make double your income or triple! But on a basic level, you can take that $650 and do a few useful things with it aside from hitting the bar or buying some new clothes.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\">3. Save for Tax Season<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"fr-style\">Although it sounds a bit dull, you can always take your earnings and save it for tax season.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">Like with this year<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014due to COVID-19<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014t<\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/filing-and-payment-deadlines-questions-and-answers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">he tax filing date has been postponed to July 15th, 2020<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">. And chances are that next year&#8217;s filing date will most likely get a bump so that people have a chance to play catchup. Plus, filing taxes as a freelancer can be a real challenge if you&#8217;re not prepared.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">As a rule of thumb, you should always try to save a third of each payday&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tax-hacks\/doing-taxes-yourself-choose-these-top-5-tax-platforms\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">for taxes, especially if you&#8217;re self-employed.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">&nbsp;Unfortunately, your clients aren&#8217;t in charge of calculating your taxes for you, which means you need to run your freelance business and act as your own accountant to ensure that you&#8217;re meeting all the right guidelines for self-employment taxes set up by the IRS.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\nThankfully, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/self-employed-individuals-tax-center\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">government makes it pretty easy to pay your taxes quarterly<\/a>, rather than all at once. So, if you make all your income from freelance work, you should definitely put some money away each month so you&#8217;re not hit with a huge sum later down the road.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>4. Think About the Future<\/h2>\n<p>And while you&#8217;re planning for tax season, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to think about the future, too&#8230;<br \/>\nIt becomes a lot easier to save money when you know what you&#8217;re saving for. Like if you want to travel to Tokyo someday or if you need extra money for a wedding with your fiance<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014setting aside a dedicated amount of funds every month will help build that future fund and help you stay prepared for any future goals.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">You may even want to consider&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/retirement-savings-tips-self-employed\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\">opening a retirement account<\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\">, like a&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fidelity.com\/learning-center\/personal-finance\/retirement\/self-employed-401k\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\">401(k)<\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\">, to routinely set aside some funds that you can rely on at an older age. Remember, as a freelancer, you don&#8217;t have an employer setting any of this up for you, so whatever initiative you can take to secure your future is always a good idea.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\">5. Increase Your Rates for Clients<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Finally, a great way to save more money is to simply increase your rates for your clients.&nbsp;<br \/>\nMaybe when you first started freelancing, you were charging a lower rate to secure more work. However, now that you&#8217;re a pro with some great impressive projects under your belt, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with setting new rates for the next quarter.&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor instance, if you&#8217;re a freelance writer charging only $.10 a word, boost your rates to $.20 per word or $.30 per word<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014something commensurate with your abilities and what your clients are willing to pay. For graphic designers<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014if you charge by the hour<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/dont-be-afraid-to-set-your-rates-and-stick-to-them\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">increase your rates to reflect what a client would pay<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"> a salaried employee doing the same job. For a professional graphic designer, an hourly rate between $35-$50 is more than reasonable for quality work.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">More than anything, just don&#8217;t sell yourself short. More money equals more savings, so if you&#8217;ve been scraping the bottom of the barrel for a while,<\/span><\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/5-signs-that-its-high-time-to-tweak-your-fiverr-rates\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"> it&#8217;s high time you make some improvements<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Keep Track of Your Savings with AND.CO<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As long as you find your savings groove and stick to it, you should have no problem saving money for when you need it most.&nbsp;<br \/>\nFreelancing and keeping track of funds can be a real challenge, but that&#8217;s why you have AND.CO to make things easier!
