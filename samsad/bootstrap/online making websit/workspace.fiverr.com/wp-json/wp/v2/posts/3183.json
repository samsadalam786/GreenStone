Here are a few you might recognize.<\/p>\n<h3>People thinking you don\u2019t have a &#8216;real job&#8217;<\/h3>\n<p>Describing yourself as self-employed used to have negative connotations. Thankfully, people are getting with the program\u2014and it\u2019s about time. The Freelancers Union estimates that <a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/65279\/40-of-americas-workforce-will-be-freelancers-by-2020\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 percent of the U.S. workforce<\/a> will be freelance by 2020.<\/p>\n<h3>People thinking you don\u2019t have a boss<\/h3>\n<p>I actually have seven. Thanks.<\/p>\n<h3>That lingering paranoia about job security, even though yours is better than most<\/h3>\n<p>One of the first things people learn about personal finance is the importance of diversification. We diversify our investments and our retirement savings, but most people do not diversify their income. If you\u2019re living your best freelance life (and have a healthy pipeline), you\u2019re better off than you might think.<\/p>\n<h3>Finishing a massive deliverable, only to realize you have 8 more hours of work ahead of you<\/h3>\n<p>Freelancing is not for the faint of heart. Why? Because you\u2019re not just managing yourself. You\u2019re running your own business. This means being a visionary CEO, a compelling CMO, an astute CFO, a savvy General Counsel and a kick-ass office manager, all in one.<\/p>\n<h3>People thinking you\u2019re available to do things like walk their dog during the day<\/h3>\n<p>See \u201cPeople thinking you don\u2019t have a real job.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Requiring all the wine to get through an entire quarter of expense-tracking<\/h3>\n<p>To be clear, we don\u2019t condone drinking while expense-tracking. But good news! If you <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sync your bank account with Fiverr Workspace<\/a>, you can avoid this situation entirely and drink wine at the bar like a normal person. \ud83d\udc4d<\/p>\n<h3>That moment when your client wants to Skype, but you are by no means camera-ready<\/h3>\n<p>That myth that freelancers lounge around their house all day in their pajamas? False. Well, most of the time. And those few days we are? Murphy\u2019s Law says we\u2019ll get at least one Google Hangout request.<\/p>\n<h3>Making it to Saturday and having no idea what day, or year, it is<\/h3>\n<p>Not having a 9-to-5 job generally means not having a Monday through Friday job. And when you work most days, there\u2019s no line between the weekend and the workweek.<\/p>\n<h3>TFW when your friend announces she\u2019s just filed her taxes with TurboTax AND received a $5,000 refund<\/h3>\n<p>LOL. What is a refund? If you\u2019re a freelancer, you are going to owe a good chunk of coin. And your taxes might even require (gasp!) a real live accountant.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting stiffed by a client<\/h3>\n<p>UGH. We hope this hasn\u2019t happened to you, but research shows it has happened to more people than you\u2019d think.
