From one-on-one check-ins to your annual performance review, you\u2019re not often left wondering what your boss is thinking.<br \/>\nWhen you\u2019re a freelancer, however? Gathering feedback from your clients can present more of a challenge. \u201cMany clients are afraid to give feedback,\u201d says freelance writer Laura Spencer, in her post for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writingthoughts.com\/why-writers-need-feedback-and-how-you-can-get-the-feedback-you-need\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Writing Thoughts<\/a>, \u201cBasically, they\u2019re afraid of how we, as freelance writers will respond.\u201d So, they avoid the confrontation altogether.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelancer-feedback-process%2F&#038;text=Feedback%20is%20a%20key%20part%20of%20how%20you%20learn%20and%20improve%20as%20a%20freelancer.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Feedback is a key part of how you learn and improve as a freelancer. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelancer-feedback-process%2F&#038;text=Feedback%20is%20a%20key%20part%20of%20how%20you%20learn%20and%20improve%20as%20a%20freelancer.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nMaybe you\u2019re met with a vague, \u201cLooks great!\u201d whenever you turn something in. Perhaps you submit your work and then hear nothing but those dreaded inbox crickets in return. Or, maybe you crank out project after project for your client\u2014without ever having a frank conversation about how the arrangement is working for the both of you, and if there\u2019s anything you could do to make things better.<br \/>\nRegardless of your specific circumstances, the problem remains the same: How can you consistently get feedback on your freelance work?<br \/>\nRest assured, it\u2019s definitely possible\u2014as long as you follow a few steps.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Establish a process<\/h3>\n<p>Sure, you work for yourself. But, why should that stop you from having a formal feedback process in place? This is something that you can (and should!) implement for your freelance clients.<br \/>\nThis doesn\u2019t need to be anything overly complex and involved. Instead, just take a few minutes to jot down what you think an ideal freelance project should look like for you.For example, maybe you\u2019ll start with an initial phone call or meeting in order to get on the same page about the deliverables and the expectations. Then, halfway through the project, you\u2019ll have an update call to make sure you both have a shared understanding of how things are working. Once you submit the project, you\u2019ll wrap things up with a feedback conversation.Or, maybe you want to keep things simple and just want to send out a quick survey following each project.<br \/>\nWhat your process will look like is up to you. But, once you\u2019ve outlined that and included slots that are specifically meant for gathering feedback, loop your clients (new and old!) in on that flow. You can even promote how your process works on your website or other marketing materials so that prospective clients can quickly glean what working with you is like.<br \/>\nThe more structured, predictable, and easy you can make the feedback process, the higher your likelihood of actually getting the information you need.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Set the&nbsp;precedent early<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, many clients are nervous to provide feedback, for fear of insulting your work or damaging the relationship. But, as a freelancer, you know that constructive criticism is an incredibly helpful tool. It\u2019s your responsibility to make that clear to your clients from the onset.<br \/>\nRight from your initial phone call, reiterate that you\u2019re always open to their suggestions and feedback. Reassure them that you won\u2019t be offended at the first sight of criticism. Instead, you\u2019ll use and implement those tweaks to continuously improve moving forward.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s imperative that you emphasize to your clients how much you value their feedback on your work.&nbsp;Once they understand that they\u2019re actually helping\u2014and not hurting\u2014you, they\u2019re much more likely to be a little more generous with their constructive criticism.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Explicitly&nbsp;ask for thoughts<\/h3>\n<p>Even with those steps in place, clients could still be a little reserved or tight-lipped with their feedback. It\u2019s in these circumstances when you should plan to explicitly ask them for their suggestions and expertise.<br \/>\nIs there a piece of the project that you\u2019re feeling stuck on? Loop in your client, tell them to take a look, and then ask what tips or thoughts they have. Is there a part that you think is especially awesome and want to ensure they agree? Make a note of that when you turn the project in.<br \/>\nYou\u2019re great at what you do. But, ultimately, your client still has a better understanding of their own business and what they\u2019re trying to accomplish with your work\u2014you rely on their insights and expertise. Specifically ask for their thoughts or opinions, and they\u2019ll begin to understand that too.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelancer-feedback-process%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20clients%20can%20often%20be%20tight-lipped%20with%20feedback.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance clients can often be tight-lipped with feedback. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelancer-feedback-process%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20clients%20can%20often%20be%20tight-lipped%20with%20feedback.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>4. Get out of your inbox<\/h3>\n<p>Email is convenient. But, being that it\u2019s pretty impersonal, it can also make it a little tricky to have those tough conversations.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re truly eager to soak up some helpful feedback, you need to be prepared to step away from your inbox and have an actual discussion with your client\u2014whether that\u2019s through a video conference, an in-person meeting, or a phone call.<br \/>\nEmail will never be able to pick up on the intended tone and delivery of a message, meaning that your client will be able to more adequately share his or her thoughts through a more personal conversation. Additionally, this gives your client the time and ability to talk things through in detail, and allows you to immediately ask any follow-up questions for clarity.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Establish a&nbsp;network<\/h3>\n<p>Of course, you want feedback from the people who are hiring you and forking over your paychecks. But, are your clients the only resource you can turn to when you\u2019re looking for constructive criticism? Absolutely not.<br \/>\n\u201cMentors and other freelancers are in many cases a better source of constructive criticism,\u201d says Steve King in his piece for <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/08\/how-to-get-feedback-as-a-freelancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business Review<\/a>.<br \/>\nBuild yourself a network of fellow freelancers, advisors, or even other people who frequently work with freelancers like you that you can turn to when you need some feedback. Oftentimes, these people are far more willing to give you some harsher insight, as they aren\u2019t as invested in the project or the relationship as your client is.<br \/>\nThe feedback they offer might not always be easy to hear. But, having that outside perspective will ultimately help you create a stronger end result.<\/p>\n<h3>Over to you<\/h3>\n<p>As a freelancer, it&#8217;s important to get feedback&nbsp;to continuously improve, keep your clients happy, and stay competitive. Follow these&nbsp;steps to make the feedback process a more predictable part of your work process. Start by&nbsp;outlining what you\u2019d like your client arrangements to look like and then go from there. You\u2019ll soon&nbsp;have a streamlined and reliable system in place that will help you consistently get the feedback you need.<br \/>\n<em><strong>What does your feedback process look like?
