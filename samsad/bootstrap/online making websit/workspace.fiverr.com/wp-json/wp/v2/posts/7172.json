Common problems for remote workers include issues falling through the cracks because of time zone differences, according to this research <a href=\"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Nancy_Kurland\/publication\/247748414_The_Advantages_and_Challenges_of_Working_Here\/links\/5444f1640cf2e6f0c0fbf7c7.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"paper (opens in a new tab)\">paper<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no wonder remote workers say communication apps are vital for keeping them connected, according to a joint <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/anywhere-new-remote-work-report\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"study (opens in a new tab)\">study<\/a> by Fiverr Workspace and RemoteYear.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the top team communication tools for remote workers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/products.office.com\/en-us\/microsoft-teams\/group-chat-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Microsoft Teams (opens in a new tab)\">Microsoft Teams<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider Microsoft Teams if you\u2019re already a heavy Microsoft user. One of Microsoft Team\u2019s biggest pros is the tight integration with the entire suite of Microsoft Office apps.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Microsoft Teams, you can hold and recordonline meetings. Remote freelancers can host web and audio conferences, or communicate via 1:1 or group messages and calls. Collaboration features include screen sharing. The free version of this tool caters for up to 300 users. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any drawbacks? The interface isn\u2019t as intuitive as the other tools on this list and may be confusing, especially for new users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.chanty.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Chanty (opens in a new tab)\">Chanty<\/a>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a simple team chat tool for your remote team?&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Chanty, you can:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Send private or group messages&nbsp;<\/li><li>Drop general updates in the relevant channel<\/li><li>Make audio and video calls<\/li><li>Share voice notes easily<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The built-in task manager helps to organize and track work. Unlike many team chat applications, Chanty offers unlimited search history across all plans.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful collaboration features include the ability to share screens and upload files in the app. Chanty\u2019s a strong contender for small to midsize remote workers who prioritize productive, deep work: smart notifications give employees total control.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, you can organize all your tasks, messages, and files in a private folder called Teambook.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Slack (opens in a new tab)\">Slack<\/a>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This Silicon Valley unicorn is one of the most popular team communications apps.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration features include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Audio and video calls&nbsp;<\/li><li>Screen sharing<\/li><li>File sharing&nbsp;<\/li><li>1:1 and group messaging&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack\u2019s known for its user-friendly interface. Public channels in workspaces are simple to navigate. Though, it\u2019s easy to get lost in the real-time messaging stream. One obvious challenge is when your remote team needs to communicate across time zones. To make it easier to respond in channels, Slack has introduced threaded messages.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another point to keep in mind is that access to unlimited message history is only available on the higher end plans.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video conferencing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By having regular video conversations, remote workers build better rapport and understanding, according to this Harvard Business Review <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2018\/02\/how-to-collaborate-effectively-if-your-team-is-remote\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"analysis (opens in a new tab)\">analysis<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, video conferencing tools only work if they\u2019re reliable and user-friendly.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the top picks for remote workers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/skype.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Skype (opens in a new tab)\">Skype<\/a>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the rise of messaging apps like Slack and Chanty, Skype was the go-to for remote work.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Skype, remote workers and freelancers can participate in group chats and online meetings.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other noteworthy video conferencing features:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add live subtitles&nbsp;<\/li><li>Blur backgrounds<\/li><li>Record meetings<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a natural choice for Microsoft users: Skype comes with the Microsoft Office suite of applications.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/tools\/dlpage\/hangoutplugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Google Hangouts&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)\">Google Hangouts&nbsp;<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Hangouts offers a simple video conferencing right from your browser. For freelancers using other G Suite apps, there\u2019s deep integration. You can, for instance, start a video call from Gmail.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Useful features include the ability to share files and messages in chat during the call. It\u2019s completely free to use and you can hold video calls with up to 25 people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/zoom.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Zoom (opens in a new tab)\">Zoom<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoom is one of the most popular video conferencing tools. You can use HD video, audio, and chat. Plus, you\u2019re allowed to record meetings, too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoom is user-friendly: use a special meeting link or download the application. The platform comes with integrations for a range of common applications, like Google Calendar, Salesforce, Dropbox, and Zapier.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Host up to 100 participants on the free version. There is a 40-minute limit on group meetings, though.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cloud storage and file sharing&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us can relate to this scenario. You\u2019re searching for a document: files are scattered across emails, instant messages, and your device\u2019s internal storage.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all leads to wasted time and effort.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, cloud storage and file sharing apps offer a better way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dropbox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Dropbox (opens in a new tab)\">Dropbox<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropbox is one of the business world\u2019s default tools for file sharing. It makes sense why. Store your files in one place; access your documents from any device.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free plan comes with 2GB storage. Paid plans come with significantly more space, starting at 3TB. But the per user cost adds up fast. Still, it\u2019s worth serious consideration for remote workers who want to boost productivity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/onedrive.live.com\/about\/en-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"OneDrive&nbsp; (opens in a new tab)\">OneDrive&nbsp;<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>OneDrive is part of the Microsoft family of productivity applications. Remote workers can easily share Microsoft files and folders. It\u2019s great for connecting to Microsoft apps, like Skype and the Office 365. Plus, saving is synced across devices, removing the need to manually save files.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can control the type of permissions, for instance editing or view. Entry level plans come with a decent storage allocation of up to 1TB per user. You also get 24\/7 phone and web support.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/box.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Box (opens in a new tab)\">Box<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Box is a cloud storage and file sharing application.Sharing is simple, and you can control access and permissions.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All project files are stored in a single workspace, a useful feature for keeping track of related documents. Entry-level plans are best suited for&nbsp; up to 10 users and come with 100 GB storage and support for 120 file types.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>File collaboration&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever ended up working on an outdated version of a document? Or how about having to manually merge changes and edits?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most modern professionals know the pain of inefficient document management.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s where file collaboration tools make all the difference.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.office.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Microsoft Office 365 (opens in a new tab)\">Microsoft Office 365<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/colorlib.com\/wp\/free-productivity-tools\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"productivity tools for business (opens in a new tab)\">productivity tools for business<\/a>, Microsoft Office 365 has long cornered the market. And though many new companies have sprung up, many freelancers still prefer the Microsoft family.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Microsoft Office 365, you can do real-time collaboration, so multiple users can work on the document at the same time. Then once it\u2019s done, you can save to OneDrive or SharePoint. Even better, all those changes are synced. Remote workers can share documents with team members or people outside the organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/gsuite.google.com\/intl\/uk\/features\/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=emea-ua-all-uk-dr-bkws-all-hv-trial-e-t2-1007172&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-none-DEV_c-CRE_167660541570-ADGP_Hybrid%20%7C%20AW%20SEM%20%7C%20BKWS%20~%20EXA_1:1_UA_UK_G%20Suite_GSB03_google%20suite-KWID_43700016342873512-kwd-36417445044-userloc_1012866&amp;utm_term=KW_google%20suite-ST_google%20suite&amp;ds_rl=1244687&amp;ds_rl=1259922&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAn8nuBRCzARIsAJcdIfNc0gy4-CSgRatHpJOO8J7W93hQ2Z6Qart1i2A_VOYiTH-3uEg75gUaAuwiEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Google Suite (opens in a new tab)\">Google Suite<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its launch in 2006, Google Suite has made collaboration easier for remote workers around the world.
