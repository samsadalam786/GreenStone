As freelancers, we tend to be in competition with ourselves. We&#8217;re trying to land that next gig, next client, and we don&#8217;t necessarily have to worry about the guy in the next cubicle. We are lucky. In this absurd sketch, two of the best dudes in the game show how pervasive competition in the workplace can be.<br \/>\n<iframe title=\"Key &amp; Peele: Competition in the Work Place\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/vQRo-ahZrAQ?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2>Meeting About Meetings &#8212; &#8220;Pssh,&#8221; says the Freelancer<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/ChicoComedy\">Chico Comedy<\/a>, NYC comedians Claire Matson and Jo Rouehib, co-wrote this wonder with comedy writer and director <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/celluloidsimple\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tony Cohen<\/a>. Useless meetings are an epidemic in offices around the country and this video does a perfectly job of heightening the specifics we all know and hate. The sketch to end all sketches that encapsulate\u00a0how terrible most meetings are and I&#8217;m obsessed with it.<br \/>\n<iframe title=\"Meeting About Meetings\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/R50tXblvMHg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Corporate Seals \u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UC310aJFjr6Gn9mGZjMZ2VTQ\">Tripp &amp; Tyler&#8217;s<\/a>\u00a0YouTube channel is full of sketches ragging on office life but &#8220;Corporate Seals&#8221; really resonates with me. It hits the phoniest parts of corporate life and highlights how much nonsense happens in offices around the country. I love a mapping sketch and this is a home run.<br \/>\n<iframe title=\"Corporate Seals\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SUtL6IS7wcY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<h2><strong>How Your Lies Really Sound When You Sneak Out For A Job Interview<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCqeXB2WsPdzcdCdP-bUc52g\">Fast Company<\/a> has been venturing into the comedy world and for this video, they remind freelancers how wonderful it is to not have to lie about having another gig. That&#8217;s our whole thing! We also don&#8217;t have to worry about sneaking out from our\u00a0office because we make our own schedules.
