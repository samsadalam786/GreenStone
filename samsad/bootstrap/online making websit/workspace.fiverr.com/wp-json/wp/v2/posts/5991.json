There\u2019s plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/lolly-daskal\/4-scientific-reasons-why-vacation-is-awesome-for-you.html\"><span class=\"s3\">scientific research<\/span><\/a> that holidays are good for your health. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/16218311\"><span class=\"s3\">5-year study<\/span><\/a> of women in rural Wisconsin found that women who took more frequent vacations had lower rates of depression and tension.&nbsp;<\/span><span class=\"s1\">The University of Pittsburgh\u2019s Mind-Body Center found that people who took more leisure time, including vacations, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/templates\/story\/story.php?storyId=111887591\"><span class=\"s3\">reported more life satisfaction<\/span><\/a>, finding more meaning in life.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Holidays are an essential part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativeboom.com\/tips\/how-to-recognise-prevent-and-deal-with-burnout\/\"><span class=\"s3\">avoiding burnout<\/span><\/a>, which apart from being stressful for you, can also be one of the quickest ways of losing clients.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span style=\"font-size: revert; color: initial;\">Without your health, there&#8217;s no one to run your business, so don&#8217;t feel guilty about taking some time for yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Once you\u2019re back from your holiday, you\u2019ll be feeling refreshed and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\/\">more productive<\/a>. Your clients will love you for it. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Right, now that&#8217;s out of the way (like you needed that much convincing), here&#8217;s how to get started.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How to take a holiday as a freelancer<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>1. Plan ahead<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Of course, preparation for your vacation is going to be essential if you want to ensure that interruption to your business is minimal and you can actually relax when you take off. Plan as far as possible ahead so that your time off work will go smoothly.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">This probably means that you\u2019ll be putting in a bit of extra work before you head off to make sure you\u2019re on top of things. It also means that you should get good at saying no to last-minute gigs before your trip. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s a good idea to have work planned for your first week back so that there\u2019s no time for post-holiday blues and you won\u2019t have the bills piling up without anything coming in. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Planning ahead also includes making sure your budget will cover your holiday expenses so you&#8217;re not adding additional stress to your time off. Choose a holiday destination that&#8217;s well within budget.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More<\/em>: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/6-unexpected-productivity-tips-for-freelancers-inspired-by-ted-talks\/\">6 Unexpected Productivity Tips for Freelancers (Inspired by TED Talks)<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>2. Communicate<\/b><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Give your clients plenty of notice that you\u2019ll be taking time off, preferably in writing. Remind them a week or so prior to your trip as well.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It sounds like basic courtesy, but you\u2019d be surprised at how this simple gesture can go a long way. They\u2019ll appreciate the forward planning and communication, and they&nbsp;may even be happy that you&#8217;re able to take a well-deserved break\u2014we&#8217;re all human after all.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>3. Schedule<\/b><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">First of all you need to schedule an &#8216;out of office&#8217; detailing your days off, whether you\u2019ll be checking or replying to email during this period, other ways your clients can reach you (if any), and an alternate contact (if applicable). <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Or, if you want your clients to share in your excitement, use this <a href=\"https:\/\/wooohooo.com\/\">out-of-office&nbsp;generator<\/a>&nbsp;created by Corona to create a personalized message.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video autoplay controls loop src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Email_900x550__BEACH_B3_GIF4_scaled-151977a4-4968-4ea8-a1fa-f886163bad42411.mp4\"><\/video><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Consider checking out the app <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inboxpause.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Inbox pause<\/span><\/a> to fight against the urge to check your emails while you&#8217;re away. Or if you\u2019re really worried about switching off completely, you could always ask a virtual assistant to monitor your inbox and text you any really urgent tasks.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on what you do for work, you may be able to make use of the WordPress scheduling tool as well as apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/\"><span class=\"s3\">Buffer<\/span><\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hootsuite.com\"><span class=\"s3\">HootSuite<\/span><\/a> to schedule social media posts for while you\u2019re away.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>4. Share the load<\/b><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">If you don\u2019t want to put certain projects or clients on hold completely, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help. Outsource your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-use-alliances-to-grow-your-freelance-business\/\">work to other freelancers<\/a>. They might even send some work your way the next time they&#8217;re taking a break.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Just make sure that you handover properly and are not compromising on quality &#8211; only refer to another freelancer friend if you know they\u2019re going to offer your clients the same standard you\u2019d produce.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-use-alliances-to-grow-your-freelance-business\/\">How to Use Alliances to Grow Your Freelance Business<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><b>5. Get creative<\/b><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Just because you\u2019re on holiday doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t be gathering inspiration for future work. Pick up ideas for stories, take some photos, write some travel blogs or meet other people who work in similar fields. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Alternatively, use your break as an opportunity to try something new. Building skills is a great way to increase your talents, improve brain power and demonstrate adaptability\u2014which can translate into better work for future clients.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>6. Ditch the guilt<\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">It\u2019s easy to feel guilty about all the work you could be doing, all the money you could be earning and all the clients you could be winning. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Remember that you\u2019re human and we all need time out every now and then. Far from a sign of weakness, it\u2019s admirable to take time out and <a href=\"https:\/\/freelancejungle.com.au\/self-care\/\"><span class=\"s3\">demonstrate self-care.<\/span><\/a><\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More<\/em>: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/best-chrome-extensions-productivity-freelancer\/\">14 Chrome Extensions to Increase Your Productivity<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hit refresh<\/span><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">You\u2019ve got everything organized, planned ahead and communicated with your clients, and you\u2019re ready to switch off and take a well-deserved break.
