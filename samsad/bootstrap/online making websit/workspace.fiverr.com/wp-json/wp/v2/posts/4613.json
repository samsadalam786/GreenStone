As you stand at the precipice of turning your dream into a reality, I\u2019m here to help.<br \/>\nAs someone who has mulled over becoming a digital nomad, and eventually making the move myself, I\u2019m here to share my tried-and-true formula for overcoming beginner\u2019s paralysis. It\u2019s called the 70-20-10 Rule, and it follows that jumping into a nomadic lifestyle is 70 percent research, 20 percent preparation and 10 percent improvisation. Let\u2019s break it down.<\/p>\n<h3><b>70 percent research<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>I am the sort of person that never goes into anything unprepared.<br \/>\nI mean, I can\u2018t even buy a toaster without spending hours poring over online reviews to make sure I\u2018m getting the best product for my buck. When I decided to go the nomad route, it was the same way and as it turns out, my obsessive need to be informed helped me immensely. If you do your research ahead of time, you will drastically cut down on the number of surprises that are in store for you. (By the way, reading this is a solid first step! Good on you.)<br \/>\nResearch can help you figure out what kind of lifestyle you want to live. Some nomads prefer to plan an extended overseas trip, spanning months or even years. They travel light, and given the distances they traverse, they rack up a ton of airline miles. Other nomads move around but remain inland, renting a motorhome or RV (some even living out of a van) and opt to drive from destination to destination. Other nomads still prefer curated experiences, in which they join a group of fellow nomads as part of an organized, community-based effort that usually \u201cdocks\u201d in one city.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, every option has perks and drawbacks. Leading a nomadic lifestyle is a delicate balance of comfort, cost and freedom\u2014pick two. If you want freedom paired with comforts, expect to pay a premium. Want something a little more comfortable, but at a lower cost? Your budget might not allow you to move as often, cutting into your freedom. The dizzying array of options and ways to balance these three qualities can be extremely overwhelming.<br \/>\nThe key is finding out what will work for you. Whatever style of travel interests you, scour the forums related to it. Read everything you can find, and take notes if you need help organizing your thoughts. Do yourself a favor and focus on the bad stuff. Yep! I am asking you to be pessimistic for a moment.<br \/>\nThere are forums and websites full of posts and comments from people who made an attempt at this lifestyle and decided it wasn\u2018t for them. Read their stories and hear them out. Put yourself in their shoes and honestly ask yourself, \u201cHow would these problems affect me?\u201d Chances are, you will find yourself modifying your plans based on the experiences of others, both good and bad.<\/p>\n<p>A critical piece of the research phase is establishing a realistic budget. No matter how you embrace this lifestyle, it\u2018s going to cost you something. You can live a nomadic lifestyle on a fixed budget, of course, but if you\u2018re careless, your new lifestyle can get very expensive very quickly. Carefully research the costs involved, and include everything that you might possibly need on the road. Food, fuel (if you\u2019re driving), transportation costs (if you\u2019re getting around that way), insurance, club memberships, entertainment, internet\u2014 just to name a few\u2014must all be considered.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Nomad tip:<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">\u201cDigital nomadism is at times chaotic, stressful, and difficult, like any job, and it can be easy to romanticize it. You have the freedom to move wherever you want, but make no mistake about it, it\u2019s still a job and all the pressures, stresses, and occasional mundane aspects that creep into any job will still be there.\u2019\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Joseph Engelmajer, Web Developer<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 300;\">Bali, Indonesia<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>When it comes to researching the various paths you may take, keep in mind that someone else has already been there and done that. Learn from their mistakes and emulate their triumphs. Optimize their experiences to suit your own goals and lifestyle needs. Stand on the shoulders of those who have gone before, and your path will be that much easier.<\/p>\n<h3><b>20 percent preparation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>So, now you know what to expect and you\u2018re ready to face the triumphs (and the pitfalls, too!) that come with it. It\u2018s time to apply what you\u2018ve learned and start preparing for your new life. Preparation will be different for every person, depending on what your research has led you to decide, but here are some general best practices for you to consider.<br \/>\nFor most people, the hardest part of the hardest part of becoming a digital nomad is cutting ties with their former \u201cstationary\u201d lives. If you own a home, selling it can often be the biggest hurdle. Perhaps you rent and need to break a lease\u2014that can be difficult, too. Deciding which possessions you can take with you and which must be sold or placed in storage is yet another step that can be physically and emotionally draining. If you have a traditional job, you\u2018ll need to give notice and plan your departure. And of course, saying farewell (albeit temporarily) to loved ones can be the hardest step of all.<\/p>\n<p>As you tie up loose ends and bid farewell to your former life, you\u2019ll need to concurrently prepare for your new life. This involves buying the things you\u2018ll need, updating insurance companies and sorting out residency and mail issues. If you have health care needs, you need to determine how you\u2018ll meet them while abroad or on the road. You should also consider joining clubs that will help you along the way. For example, for mobile nomads there are several roadside assistance companies that offer discounts at hotels and RV parks. International nomads might seek out local meetups or communities of nomads in the areas they intend to live. Depending on how you choose to travel, you might sign up for one or a dozen.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that if you\u2018ve done your research, this should be the easiest step. You should know exactly what you need to do, and what equipment you\u2018ll need to make a nomadic life feasible. This is also the most exciting step, because you can finally see the fruits of all your research paying off. You\u2018re about to start your new journey, and it\u2018s so close you can almost reach out and touch it.<\/p>\n<h3><b>10 percent improvisation<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>This is the final phase, and it never really ends. While research and preparation will minimize the number of unpleasant surprises you encounter, no matter how much research you do or how well you prepare, you\u2018re going to run into something that you don\u2018t quite know how to handle. This could be anything from issues with internet connectivity to challenges getting around a new remote city. It could even involve an illness or injury, far from home and your preferred doctor.<\/p>\n<p>Being able to think on your feet and roll with whatever comes your way is a requirement for leading a nomadic lifestyle. Encountering a show-stopping issue can be scary\u2014particularly if it seems like it might be very expensive to solve, or if it involves your health or wellbeing. The key is to remain calm and focus on solutions, not problems. I\u2018m a firm believer that where there\u2019s a will, there\u2018s a way; you just need to match your willpower to the task at hand.<br \/>\nFinally, remember being \u201cindependent,\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being alone. Don\u2018t be afraid to rely on fellow wanderers. The people I\u2018ve run into while living as a nomad have been the kindest, most helpful folks I\u2018ve ever met, and if you take to the internet you\u2019ll find thousands of friendly, helpful people just waiting to offer up their wisdom at a moment\u2019s notice.<\/p>\n<p>On a personal note, making the leap into a nomadic lifestyle has been the most freeing, happiest, and scariest experience of my life. I wouldn\u2018t trade it for anything\u2014and I believe that if you approach it with the right attitude, you won\u2018t want to give it up, either.<br \/>\n<i>For more information like this, download <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/digital-nomad-book?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=text-bottom-anywhere-ebook&amp;utm_campaign=70-20-10\"><i>Anywhere, the free handbook for digital nomads here<\/i><\/a><i>. <\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Making the leap to become a digital nomad is no small task.
