We know that working for different clients, keeping ad hoc hours, and creating&nbsp;your&nbsp;own weekly schedule&nbsp;can often mean going&nbsp;months without taking a break from your laptops! And even if you&#8217;re a nonstop worker, you need the occasional break.<br \/>\nSo, shut down your iPad, take a deep breath and take the break you deserve!&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;a few tech-free breaks you can take, wherever you live:<\/p>\n<h1><b>Take A Hike!<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Freelancers&nbsp;spend a great deal of their day in a 2 dimensional world of pixels and PowerPoints. We get it, it\u2019s easy to get lost in your work&nbsp;when you do what you love every day, but we all&nbsp;need a break from the grindstone once in a while. Take a hike from&nbsp;Safari tabs,&nbsp;and get lost in the 3rd dimension. Literally. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alltrails.com\/?ref=header\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Take&nbsp;a hike.<\/a> The fresh air, beautiful scenery, and physical exercise&nbsp;will&nbsp;leave you revitalized and refreshed. After all, computers aren\u2019t the only things that need de-fragging once in a while. Go out into the wild and start clearing your cache!<\/p>\n<h1><b>Volunteer<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Freelancers are the kings and queens of time-sheets! Juggling different clients and clocking your hours can get confusing and exhausting. We suggest you take a little vacation from clocking-in and volunteer some <i>free<\/i> time at a local charity. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t right click and delete bullying, or copy\/paste some love over neglected animals, but you <em>can<\/em> lend your time and love to help local charities make a real difference. Check out websites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.volunteermatch.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volunteer Match<\/a>&nbsp;to find a great opportunity near you!<\/p>\n<h1><b>Listen To Music\u2026 LIVE<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Everyone has that perfect Pandora channel or Spotify playlist that churns out hit after hit as you work on tedious projects and spreadsheets. We know you\u2019ve spent a lot of time cultivating this fountain of musical gold but sometimes it\u2019s good to unplug the Bose headphones and soak up some <i>live<\/i> beats. Technology might be able to give you a plethora of artists in one tiny metal box, but how&nbsp;annoying are those adverts and buffering pauses?&nbsp;With live music, you can sit back and enjoy those groovy tunes without having to login and hope your browser remembered your password. Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/whereislivemusic.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Where Is Live Music<\/a> to find some live jams in your area.<\/p>\n<h1><b>Go To A Cafe And Just Have A Coffee<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>Years ago, before Apple Macintoshes and Stylus pens, people used to go to coffee shops to just sit and drink coffee. Crazy, we know. They would sit and soak up the ambience, enjoy iced teas and watch the world go by (and a plug socket was not the biggest deciding factor on where they sat). We suggest you take a break from the norm and leap back in time. Leave your electronics at home, walk down to your local coffee shop, order a huge Frappacino and unplug yourself!<\/p>\n<h1><b>Read A Book<\/b><\/h1>\n<p>We read so many documents, emails, texts and <a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack<\/a>&nbsp;messages that we forget what it\u2019s like to read something we can\u2019t hit reply-all to. Kindles might have revolutionized how to read a book, but there is still something to be said for turning a page. In a world where everything is measured in MB, it\u2019s understandable that hauling a 5lb copy of Ken Follett\u2019s Winter of the World in your backpack might seem silly. But there\u2019s something to be said for picking up a dog-eared copy of The Life of Pi, feel the weight of the story in your hands, and read like it\u2019s 1954. This type of \u2018manual reading\u2019 might feel barbaric at first, but at least it won\u2019t jump to page 256 because your little pinky hit the corner of the screen. &nbsp;So take a break from spell checking your emails and get lost in a story that doesn\u2019t require battery life!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freelancers don&#8217;t typically&nbsp;get&nbsp;set vacation days, so finding the time to clock-out can be tricky.
