Overcoming the temptation to press the snooze button one more time is all on you, and if you\u2019re not getting the most out of your day, you\u2019re only hurting yourself and your bottom line.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What you need is some strategies to help you stay productive, every. damn. day.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re too busy trying to be productive to watch all of these TED Talks, don\u2019t worry\u2014I\u2019ve picked out the top tip from each so you can go straight to the key takeaway. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1.

And with the amount of things we do at once in our daily lives\u2014like watching TV while texting or cooking\u2014many of us feel like we have this skill down pat. But <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/225321\">research has shown<\/a> that multitasking is not only ineffective, it causes us to make mistakes and even lowers our IQ. Paolo Cardini teaches us that mono-tasking is much more effective. In his two-and-a-half minute talk, he explains that we should focus on one task at a time\u2014starting by downgrading our mobiles into the essence of their function.<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 854px\">\n<div style=\"height: 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><b>2.

But research has shown that it\u2019s actually your attitude to stress that determines the effect it has on you. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In this talk, psychologist Kelly McGonigal shares that the 15th highest cause of death in the U.S. is \u2018stress belief\u2019\u2014<em>not stress itself.<\/em>&nbsp;What that means is that people are more likely to die from stress-related illness if they believe that stress is harmful to their health. Those who are highly stressed but don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s harmful are actually the group least likely to die. By reshaping how you think about stress, and viewing symptoms like a faster heartbeat, faster breath and sweating as your body preparing to act against a challenge, you\u2019re more able to turn stress into something productive.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 854px\">\n<div style=\"height: 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><b>4.

Giving yourself an opportunity to rejuvenate could help you to return more productive and more inspired by new creative ideas. Designer Stefan Sagmeister has embraced this concept by closing his New York studio every seven years for a year-long sabbatical. Often he comes up with innovative projects during this time off, and he shares some of the projects he created when he was in Bali in this talk.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 854px\">\n<div style=\"height: 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><b>5.

He believes this is due to the myriad systems, metrics, management layers, and processes we have in place, which stop us from focusing on getting the stuff that matters done. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re a freelancer or remote worker, chances are you love your freedom, so you\u2019re already halfway towards escaping this cause of productivity decline. Morieux also argues that collaboration, rather than competition, can help increase our productivity &#8211; so perhaps you can look for ways to collaborate more closely with your clients or with other freelancers. <\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"max-width: 854px\">\n<div style=\"height: 0;padding-bottom: 56.25%\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h2><b>Find your flow<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There\u2019s plenty of great content out there that\u2019ll give you tips for being more productive, but it\u2019s all about finding something that works for you.
