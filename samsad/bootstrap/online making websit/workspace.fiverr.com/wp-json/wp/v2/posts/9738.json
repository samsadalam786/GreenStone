We think we\u2019re being pushy or that we\u2019re nagging. It\u2019s uncomfortable and, we fear, annoying.&nbsp;Unfortunately, as freelance business owners we face this predicament more often than we\u2019d like.&nbsp;Everyone who has freelanced long enough has at least one story about a client who disputed charges, was late on a payment, or just outright refused to pay. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/\">The Freelancer&#8217;s Union<\/a>&nbsp;found that 71% of freelancers have had trouble getting paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even though we\u2019ve done the work and satisfied our end of the transaction, we\u2019re still leery about asking for payment. Maybe we imagine that asking indicates that we don\u2019t trust our client\u2019s motives. Maybe they&#8217;ll think we\u2019re impeaching their character. After all, we wouldn\u2019t need to ask them to pay if we already knew they were going to pay, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>There&#8217;s nothing to fear<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step to collecting overdue accounts is to recognize that the narrative you&#8217;re telling yourself about nagging and badgering simply isn\u2019t true. Most people want to settle their debts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick way to dispel this myth is to ask yourself a question: do you feel badgered when your clients check in on the progress of the work you\u2019re doing for them? I\u2019d be willing to bet the answer is no. You recognize that they\u2019re just interested in a progress report. They want to know the status of your end of the transaction.<br>The same applies to you. When you ask after payment, your clients recognize that you\u2019re looking for a status report on their end of the transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A client that plans to pay but hasn\u2019t gotten around to it for one reason or another will not take exception to being reminded. At worst, they\u2019ll be embarrassed that your payment has slipped through the cracks &#8211; and as a result, grateful for the reminder.<\/p>\n\n\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fintent%2Ftweet%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.and.co%252Ffreelancersblog%252Ffreelance-knowledge%252Fhow-to-write-an-overdue-payment-reminder-letter%252F%26text%3DA%2520client%2520that%2520plans%2520to%2520pay%2520but%2520hasn%25E2%2580%2599t%2520gotten%2520around%2520to%2520it%2520will%2520not%2520take%2520exception%2520to%2520being%2520reminded.%2520Dispel%2520your%2520fear%2520of%2520sending%2520an%2520invoice%2520reminder%2520and%2520learn%2520how%2520to%2520write%2520an%2520effective%2520one.%2520%2523FreelanceIsntFree%26via%3Dandco%26related%3Dandco&#038;text=A%20client%20that%20plans%20to%20pay%20but%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20gotten%20around%20to%20it%20will%20not%20take%20exception%20to%20being%20reminded.%20Dispel%20your%20fear%20of%20sending%20an%20invoice%20reminder%20and%20learn%20how%20to%20write%20an%20effective%20one.%20%23FreelanceIsntFree&#038;related' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A client that plans to pay but hasn\u2019t gotten around to it will not take exception to being reminded.

You spend your limited time delivering your clients what they want and need. You take this very seriously and your customers benefit. You\u2019ve met your client\u2019s objectives and timelines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t you expect reciprocal respect from them?&nbsp;You know your clients would be upset with you if you delivered late and you would do whatever it took to make things right. It\u2019s more than fair for you to expect your clients to uphold their end of the transaction in the same way.<br><em>For more about invoicing, take a look at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing-guide.html\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s guide to invoicing as a freelancer.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Overdue payment reminder letters<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"320\" height=\"320\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/1c389f34-ae8e-4524-86ac-e051265a0beb.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9758\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/1c389f34-ae8e-4524-86ac-e051265a0beb.jpeg 320w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/1c389f34-ae8e-4524-86ac-e051265a0beb-300x300.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/1c389f34-ae8e-4524-86ac-e051265a0beb-150x150.jpeg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do we collect our debts now that we recognize we have every right to and that our customers won\u2019t hold our efforts against us? And how do we minimize the amount of time spent pursuing overdue accounts? A properly-worded overdue payment reminder letter is the perfect strategy. These short, pointed emails serve both as friendly reminders and requests for payment. They\u2019re polite enough to avoid any whiff of condescension but still firm enough to make clear your expectations. They demonstrate that you take both your client and yourself seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Before the invoice is due<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two phases to your collection efforts. In phase one you\u2019re simply reminding your customer of the coming due date. This is not always necessary (for example, if you know your client is a prompt payer), but if you are at all concerned about your invoice being paid on time, a reminder in advance can help keep things on track.&nbsp;Send an email a week before the payment deadline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tone should be friendly and informational. You&#8217;re not asking for payment, because payment isn\u2019t due yet. This email is intended only to remind your customer of the impending invoice and, most importantly, plant the seed in their mind that you\u2019re a business that\u2019s serious about getting paid. Customers are less likely to procrastinate on you if they know that you\u2019re watching your invoices carefully. Try this sample letter.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subject: Following up on invoice&nbsp;<strong>[your invoice number here]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Message:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi&nbsp;<strong>[client name]<\/strong>,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hope things are going well for you.&nbsp;<strong>[Consider adding a pleasantry specific to your client.]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just a quick reminder that invoice&nbsp;<strong>[invoice number here]<\/strong>&nbsp;will be coming due on&nbsp;<strong>[invoice due date]<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you get a moment please take the opportunity to look over the invoice. &nbsp;I\u2019m happy to answer any question you might have.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for your business!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Your name]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your client is a procrastinator, this email alone may be enough to spur them into action. &nbsp;If they\u2019re forgetful, it may be the reminder they need. The tone is pleasant and the reminder is couched in an offer to answer questions, which flips the arrow of responsibility and allows your client to feel like they\u2019re being taken care of, even as you\u2019re looking out for yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks.html\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"328\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/C98qLQeXgAAe1B_-1024x328.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9759\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/C98qLQeXgAAe1B_-1024x328.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/C98qLQeXgAAe1B_-300x96.jpg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/C98qLQeXgAAe1B_-768x246.jpg 768w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/C98qLQeXgAAe1B_.jpg 1125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>While not necessary, you may consider sending out a second reminder on the invoice due date. The tone should be identical to the first. You could say something like, \u201cThis is just a quick reminder that invoice&nbsp;<strong>[invoice number here]<\/strong>&nbsp;is due today. If you\u2019ve already made payment please disregard this message and we thank you. As always it\u2019s a pleasure doing business with you.\u201d Again, keep it friendly and light. You\u2019re only trying to stay on your customer\u2019s radar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>After the payment is late<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In phase two, your tone begins to shift. These overdue payment reminder letters should remain professional and friendly, but you\u2019ll begin inflecting a firm expectation of payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Subject: Invoice&nbsp;<strong>[your invoice number here]&nbsp;<\/strong>is overdue<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Message:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi&nbsp;<strong>[client name]<\/strong>,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our records indicate that invoice&nbsp;<strong>[invoice number here]<\/strong>&nbsp;is currently outstanding. Payment in the amount of&nbsp;<strong>[invoice amount]<\/strong>&nbsp;was due one week ago. If you would look into this we would very much appreciate it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that life can be busy, and details can be missed. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>I<\/strong>f there\u2019s anything we can do to facilitate payment, please let us know. You have any questions we\u2019re happy to answer them. You need another copy of the invoice just let us know.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Sincerely,<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Your name]<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This email isn\u2019t overbearing or harassing. It still couches your request for payment in a way that sounds like you\u2019re being helpful to the client. However now you are making a specific request for payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue sending emails like the one above every week until the bill is paid. With each iteration, your tone can become less congenial and more direct. Your client needs to sense how serious you are about collecting your payment. Ask them directly if they still have it. Ask them to reach out to you and confirm receipt. Begin to put the onus of contact on them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 30 days overdue, your tonal transition is complete. You\u2019re no longer giving your customer the benefit of the doubt. At this point they should sense from you that you recognize they are badly in default and need to square their account immediately. However, remember that they are still your client and you\u2019re not looking to damage the relationship. Keep things professional but firm, and always offer to help however you can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>This will usually work\u2026 Except when it doesn\u2019t<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With well-executed overdue payment reminder letters, you\u2019ll be surprised how less frequently accounts become seriously overdue, but occasionally it will still happen. When your emails aren\u2019t successful, moving to paper demand letters can help spur a client to action.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having these letters mailed by a third party adds a layer of urgency, as if they\u2019re hearing from a law office or a collections agency who is&nbsp;demanding payment based on what can be viewed as a breach of contract.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks.html\">Williams &amp; Harricks<\/a>&nbsp;sends a real demand letter&nbsp;by mail for only $12, written on your behalf (not by you).
