A working adult can also benefit from having someone they look up to, as well. You probably already have a few individuals who you admire in your industry past and present, but what about people whose work habits you want to emulate? It\u2019s not as glamorous, but those productive qualities can be put into place right now. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And they don\u2019t need to necessarily be people you know, either. Get a bit creative, and set high standards\u2014 super high standards. Today, we are exposed to superheroes via films (thanks Marvel and 20th Century Fox!), TV, and traditional platforms like comics. That&#8217;s why us freelancers can aspire to be like the heroes in the stories. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are six superheroes who would make great freelancers in and out of the comics, and what you could learn from each of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The Flash &#8212; The Obvious Freelancer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the spots on this list, the one belonging to the Flash is obvious. This is a hero that literally moves at the speed of light, so can you imagine how much he\u2019ll get done on any given day? Even though some superfans have done the math and figured out the Flash would be somewhat slowed down to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mtv.com\/news\/2355920\/the-flash-calories-burned\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consume the tons of calories<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in order to perform at his peak, that\u2019s but a small trade off ripping through your to-do list. Unfortunately, you will never be able to move like this guy. But take your first step towards a productive and speedy day by finding your time sucks and eliminating or automate them (thanks, AND CO!). Then, make use of some strict timers. Might we suggest the old <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.marinaratimer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pomodoro technique<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Punctuate dedicated blocks of time with short breaks, and get one task one per block.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Spawn &#8212; Impervious to Freelance Stress\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dude is literally from hell, so we\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone more able to deal with your most headache-inducing clients. Just imagine a not-so-great day, with a client heaping unrealistic expectations on you, and then erupting when you signal even the slightest amount of pushback. A lot of us would cave and internalize that frustration, but not Spawn. A chronically upset client is nothing compared to what he has to deal with on a day to day basis. While we certainly don\u2019t recommend popping off if you want to keep your client\u2019s business, it is worth your time to learn how to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/handling-difficult-clients#sm.00000jf1jgtz72dyzwiq3gnr01m3n\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improve your communication skills<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many times, we tend to work people from the same angle, but when you\u2019re dealing with someone who is super stubborn it pays to know of several other entry points for negotiation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Jean Grey &#8212; The Client Whisperer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jean Grey has the superpower I think most of us actually want. She can read minds. That telepathy is no joke and is probably the most practical superpower out there. Think about it\u2014 no one needs to know you have it. Super strength is obvious, and you\u2019ll get so many requests for favors once other find out. Flight is cool but a) the sky is really cold, and b) people will gawk if you try to pull that off in broad daylight. But you can make full use of mind-probing in your favorite lazy day sweats. We all know how frustrating it is to work for people who don\u2019t want to come right out and tell you what they want, or at least can\u2019t express it fully. Knowing exactly what\u2019s on their mind at any point is a huge help and can make your job that much easier. Chances are none of you reading this are telepaths, so we\u2019ll have to resort to normal human improvement instead.

They have very similar skill sets and bank accounts, but Bruce Wayne is dead set on operating exclusively at night\u2014 and we all know how valuable those wee small hours are to a freelancer&#8230;even in the comics. Iron Man\u2019s suit doesn\u2019t really have any practical usage for most freelancers, but his bank account sure does. He\u2019d probably be rocking <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the best tech and gear<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make working more pleasant or, dare we say, fun.

Set greenback goals and be sure to treat yourself to a work related good every once in awhile. It\u2019s what Iron Man would do.

Barbara Gordon, paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair. She doesn\u2019t let that slow her down, though. She discovers that he has a deep understanding of tech, and she takes up the new identity of Oracle. Now, she\u2019s a super-consultant, who works as an information broker and master computer scientist and hacker. She\u2019s anyone that the coding freelancer should be looking up to. And if you don\u2019t know how to code, the least you could do is try to get on her level by taking an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/flatironschool.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">online course<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

But for the rest of us, we should look up to his genius level intellect and insatiable curiosity. We get the feeling that if tasked with an assignment, T\u2019Challa would either know enough about the subject matter to crank out an amazing project or know exactly where to look to acquire that knowledge.
