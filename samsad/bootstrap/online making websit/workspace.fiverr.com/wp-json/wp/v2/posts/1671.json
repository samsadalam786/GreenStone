Don&#8217;t worry, you just might be in the icy grip of a freelancing cold spell. While you\u2019re putting together a gameplan to weather the storm, it\u2019s not a bad idea to take the time to start thinking about how you can improve your value in the eyes of future clients. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re not saying that your work isn\u2019t already awesome, but you occasionally update your wardrobe or get a haircut, don\u2019t you? The same principle applies to your professional life. Here are a few ways to make yourself more appealing to potential clients, so you can emerge from your foxhole fresher than ever before:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tailor Your Social Media to Fit Your Audience\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A robust social media presence is your chance to show potential clients that you actually know what you\u2019re talking about. Think for a moment\u2014 would you hire the person who emails you and says, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a pretty good web designer\u201d, or the one who has a section of the web that backs up those claims? Keep in mind your audience and the kind of gigs you want, then make sure your personal social media accounts reflect that. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might hear some self-proclaimed social media \u201cgurus\u201d talk about erring on the safe side, but it doesn\u2019t always pay to be straight edge. You\u2019re looking to write for a digital publication that treasures a writer\u2019s voice? You\u2019d better make sure editors can get a preview of that from your Twitter or Facebook feeds. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fix Your Freelance Resume<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An easy win. When you\u2019re a monster freelancer who\u2019s picking up gig after gig, you might forget to take a break and update your resume. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a bit of a freelancing jack of all trades, it might be wise to actually have multiple resumes with histories that cover every walk of your freelance life. Combining your editorial or consulting experience to fit on one page may save time, but it might raise an eyebrow as a potential client begins to wonder what your primary focus really is. We\u2019re not doubting that a person can be talented at two different things, but you can\u2019t deny that you wouldn\u2019t find it slightly weird if a restaurant hyped up both its fried chicken and vegan cheeseburgers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make Sure You Blog!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why spend time blogging when you could be outside playing stickball, or inside watching <em>Friends<\/em>? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one likes extra homework, but the benefits of blogging are twofold. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first one is a bit obvious\u2014 future clients are able to see snippets of your work, and that you care about it enough to pursue your craft when there\u2019s nothing in it for you. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, you get to flex that writing muscle. It\u2019s dangerous to only write when a deadline is looming, and blogging regularly will keep you sharp. It will also encourage you to stay on top of goings-on in the industry, as you\u2019re looking for developments and breakthroughs in your particular field. Practice can be messy, so remember that not every post needs to be public. \u00a0This isn\u2019t limited to writers, either. \u201cBlogging\u201d could include web development, new site builds, and consulting scenarios that can be used as resources for other professionals. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do Get Certified<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a freelance job becomes easier when you can say \u201chey, I\u2019m good at this, and here is the proof.\u201d You don\u2019t have to go out to your local college or university and pass up a down payment on a car, but no one\u2019s stopping you. For the rest of us, there\u2019s plenty of places online (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coursera.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Coursera<\/a>) where you can take free university classes, complete with exams and certificates of completion. Not one for commitment? That\u2019s cool too. Upwork allows you to attach the results of \u201cqualification\u201d exams to your freelancer profile, so clients can see just how smart you really are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stay Interesting<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning on taking a cool vacation? Have plans to participate in a rally or outdoor event this weekend? Or maybe you got the hookup to a concert preview. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s up your alley, reach out to potentially interested parties beforehand and suggest contributing an article or photography. It\u2019s hard to imagine an arts editor turning down the chance to publish a review of an exclusive gallery preview or photos from a cool music festival. The trick here is to make sure your pitches are perfectly polished. You also want to reach out to an editor that is welcoming to freelancers of your level. If you\u2019re looking to build clout, it may not be a good idea to bank on the Washington Post allowing you to cover a major street fair. But a smaller blog might be more receptive to the idea. And if it goes well, you just might get a regular freelance job.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be Visible a Visible in the Freelance Community<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019re not just talking bylines, here. Make sure you are physically present. Part of the freelance hustle means knowing where organic connections can be made. Networking events are fine, but they can be uncomfortable for many people. It might be easier for you to go to events that are directly related to your creative goals. If there\u2019s a panel discussion that\u2019s related to the work you do, check it out\u2014 maybe an editor from your favorite publication will be there. When a friend asks you to spit some knowledge on an episode of their podcast, don\u2019t pass it up. Keep the audio file and send it along to a potential client, or use it as fuel for your blog. Don\u2019t become a sycophant, but remember that in the freelance world, half of the job is (literally) showing up. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you\u2019re looking extra-good, head on over to the Fiverr Workspace job board and find your next all-star assignment.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Having a hard time getting a freelance job?
