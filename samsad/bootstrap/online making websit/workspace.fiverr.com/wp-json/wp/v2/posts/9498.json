It is the best time to make annual resolutions that will take your business to new heights. With so many things to achieve, it can be difficult to determine which ones should be a priority for 2021.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>To start the year right, we have compiled some key strategies you should consider to make your freelance business thrive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>1. Figure out your next steps<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The release of a vaccine means we can finally see the end of the pandemic on the horizon. Since the economy may recover soon, there are plenty of opportunities for freelancers in the remote work era. But to make the most out of the upcoming months, figure out your next steps.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Begin by asking yourself these questions:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>What do you want to achieve when the economy improves?<\/li><li>What are your dream freelance gig roles or clients?&nbsp;<\/li><li>How do you plan to fulfill your objectives?<\/li><li>How will you improve your relationship with your clients?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>These questions may be simple but they can help you figure out what you need to do to get to where you want to be.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>2. Take online courses&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Do not stick to having just one freelance service. Instead, learn new skills and expand your skillset. Having more freelance services will help you attract more clients and expand your business at a faster pace.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you are a freelance photographer, try to learn video editing as well. Likewise, you could also improve your performance by taking creative courses in photo manipulation or color grading.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Learn from Fiverr has a large collection of highly practical and step-by-step online courses that can help you upgrade your freelance business. They have programs in marketing, design, business, writing, video, and many more. You can find beginner courses like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.fiverr.com\/courses\/adobe-photoshop-fundamentals?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_medium=blog\">Adobe Photoshop Fundamentals<\/a>&nbsp;and advanced courses for pros like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/learn.fiverr.com\/courses\/facebook-ads-techniques-increase-your-campaign-results?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_medium=blog\">Facebook Ads Techniques: Increase Your Campaign Results. &nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>3. Network with other freelancers&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>No man is an island and the same is true in the freelance industry. To get the best opportunities, network with other freelancers in your niche. Professional connections could help you snag bigger projects and a golden ticket for professional development. You can start by joining online groups like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/guavabean\/\">Guavabean<\/a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/remotejobsfordigitalnomads\/\">Digital Nomads<\/a>, or attend networking events in your own community.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>4. Offer additional services<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A good tip to increase your revenue stream is to offer additional services. A freelance writer could learn graphic design or social media management to be more useful to their clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>When you have confidently learned these new skills, offer a \u201cservice bundle\u201d. This way, clients can avail of several services simultaneously at premium rates. Some clients may be interested in other services that you can offer which will drastically improve your profits. AND.CO will help you create beautiful&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\">proposals<\/a>&nbsp;and secure&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\">contracts<\/a>&nbsp;to fit your new services and bundles.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>5. Aim for bigger long-term projects<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Some freelance projects take a few days or hours to complete. When they are done, you will be on the lookout for new projects or clients. Finding new projects usually takes time and plenty of back and forth, especially with new clients. If you want to keep earning, it is better to aim for bigger long-term projects. Not only will this keep your calendar full, but it will also ensure you have a constant stream of revenue. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>6. Promote your business<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Clients will not be able to find you if they do not know your business exists. Hence, promote your business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Launch social media posts or get published in popular blogs in your niche or industry.&nbsp;Find job opportunities or potential leads on LinkedIn. More importantly, create an account on freelance platforms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_medium=blog\">Fiverr<\/a>&nbsp;to expand your reach.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Fiverr freelancers have access to thousands of clients and consistent work. What&#8217;s more, they can get paid on time every time for each project.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Remember: All publicity is good publicity when it comes to your freelance business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>7. Attend virtual events<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>In-person events have been postponed due to the current pandemic. Until we see the light at the end of the tunnel, attend virtual events to make connections in your industry.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Look at popular websites or companies in your industry. Next, find out if they are hosting online webinars and attend them to meet new people. Join online Facebook groups with like-minded professionals where you can find potential project opportunities.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, these connections will pay off in the form of new clients or larger projects in 2021. We can never tell where the next big opportunity is going to come from. So, every little effort counts in attracting more prospects.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>8. Build a relationship with existing clients<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Current and past freelance clients are valuable connections. Since they have already experienced your services, they are more likely to hire you again when needed. Some clients may even have potential projects on their pipeline.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>To get these opportunities, reach out to existing clients and ask if they have any projects that could need your assistance. Likewise, propose new projects that could generate value for your customers.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>For instance, if you were hired as a freelance logo designer, ask clients whether they are interested in your other services. Maybe you could create infographics, brochures, or social media photos. Upselling your other services is key to getting more out of your current clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>9. Use freelance tools to boost productivity<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Thanks to technology, there are many freelance tools available at your fingertips. You can use Zoom for video calls, Trello for project management, and Paypal for payments. While these tools are reliable, there are also freelance tools that can centralize your day-to-day operations all-in-one place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\">AND.CO<\/a>&nbsp;offers a suite of freelance tools that can handle proposals, invoices, time tracking, payments, expenses, task lists, and reports. Meaning you can boost your productivity and focus on the work which matters most.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Grow your freelance business in 2021&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>The pandemic and lockdowns may have severely affected your freelance business. As businesses plan to recover in 2021, there are a lot of opportunities for professional freelancers. The ability to work with clients from across the globe or join the Fiverr platform gives you access to thousands of opportunities.
