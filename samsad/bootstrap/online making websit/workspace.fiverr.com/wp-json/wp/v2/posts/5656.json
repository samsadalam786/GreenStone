Is the mention of \u2018billable hours\u2019 enough to make you itch with hives? Maybe you thought there\u2019d be a little more \u201cfreedom\u201d involved in the freelance lifestyle\u2026 Sorry to break it to you, but at some stage in every successful freelancer\u2019s business, making friends with time tracking is non-negotiable. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a standard eight or nine hour working day, it\u2019s crucial for any solo business owner to account for where each of those hours goes, and then plan accordingly. The alternative is something many of us will be familiar with: stress, competing deadlines and all-nighters to compensate. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What your day looks like is up to you; this isn\u2019t about a dictatorial one-size-fits-all system. This is about gaining clarity and focus to help you in your business.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re still in the process of making friends with time tracking, these time tracking tips and potential pitfalls should keep you in check and eventually turn you from slacker to pro tracker.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Let time tracking tame your project budgets<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the right time tracking system, you can easily get a handle on how you bill and budget for client work. This goes for jobs you bill based on a project fee, retainer fee <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a time-based rate. It works like this:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The time tracking tool allows you to set an estimated time to complete the project<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any time you\u2019re working on that project, you\u2019ve got the timer running and every minute is tracked<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can opt-in for alerts when you hit a certain amount of time tracked<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the project is signed off, you\u2019ve got a clear report on how long it took and how that relates to the project budget and fee.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be a real game changer. It points out the projects where you\u2019ve underestimated the time or undercharged for certain parts of the job. Eventually, this insight will guide how you price your services and help you avoid underselling yourself.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Pitfall watch: <\/i><\/b><b>Make sure you\u2019re disciplined with your tracking. <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember: time tracking only works if you use it! So for every phone call, video conference, meeting commute, \u201cfinal\u201d change, email exchange or administrative task, you\u2019re tracking time. Whether you set these tasks as billable or non-billable is up to you\u2014the point is, the time you spend is accounted for.<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Read more:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/using-time-tracker-game-changer-freelancers\/\">Why Using a Time-Tracker is a Game-changer for Freelancers <\/a><\/strong><\/p>\n<h2><b>Let time tracking boost your productivity<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancers can often fall into the trap of expecting each day to equate to 8 straight hours of mega productive, 100% billable work. It\u2019s usually a steep learning curve to figure out that that\u2019s not the case. Enter time tracking insights. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through dedicated use of a time tracking tool over a few weeks, you\u2019ll start to spot unique patterns in how you work. While you tried to stick to a regular schedule, maybe some days that only accounted to four or five hours of client work. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the work-from-home brigade, perhaps those mornings you took an hour to walk your dog to the park were followed by a shorter but ultra-productive day. You might consider building this into your schedule permanently if it helps you stay focused and energized.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Pitfall watch:<\/i><\/b><b> Don\u2019t freak out when the results scare the &amp;%$# out of you<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time tracking has a way of scaring even seasoned entrepreneurs. The shock of seeing how you\u2019ve over-serviced or under-budgeted can be jarring. This is completely normal when you start to diligently track your time!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might also notice your work energy and output waxes and wanes throughout the course of a month. Blame the moon if you will. Or things like over-scheduling meetings, poor planning\u2014even plain old burnout. The main thing is to take advantage of this bird\u2019s eye view from your time tracking reporting and make the necessary changes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Build sustainable time tracking habits<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make time tracking work, it has to become habitual. Habits aren\u2019t easy to cement. We know <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/ejsp.674\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">from studies like this one<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that the average time it takes to form a lasting habit is 66 days. That\u2019s over two months of steady adherence to something that (let\u2019s be honest) usually feels like a drag. So how can you add to your chances of success? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It starts with commitment. Know that like any new habit or business system, building it into your daily routine won\u2019t be without teething problems. For your first couple of months, try to stick at it and know that doing at least some time tracking is much better than doing nothing at all. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great way to make the habit stick is through the \u2018Anchoring\u2019 technique. This is where you associated a new task (time tracking) with an existing habit that\u2019s already deeply entrenched in your routine. For you, this might be the email check you do each morning to start your day. Or it might be when you\u2019ve made your morning coffee and sat down to start work. Whatever it is, make sure it\u2019s something instinctive and regular.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b><i>Pitfall watch<\/i><\/b><b>: If you fall off the time tracking wagon, jump back on again<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s okay if you get crazy busy and miss a few hours (or days) of tracking at the start. Remember, we\u2019re playing the long game here. There\u2019s no harm in going back and estimating the hours you worked the previous day &#8211; this will still give you some (albeit imperfect) visibility over the time you have spent on certain tasks. As long as you keep repeating the time tracking routine daily, it\u2019ll eventually set in as a regular, productivity-boosting habit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Take the first step<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It may seem like a big task initially, but the first step to improving your productivity through time tracking is to simply give it a try.
