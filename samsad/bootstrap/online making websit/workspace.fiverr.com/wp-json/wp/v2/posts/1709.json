It\u2019s a simple question but a vital one for content marketers and freelancers who want to create brand awareness. Google SERPs give one set of data points, but a SERP placement is really how popular or useful Google thinks a link is.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A much surer method of finding out what\u2019s popular is to use social media shares. The share is the ultimate social media virality marker. People have to take the time and the risk of putting a particular piece of content up on their stream when they share. It invites a response from all of the people who see that feed. More than a simple like, a share shows true investment in a piece of content.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But finding out how many people shared a piece of content was a real pain, at least until BuzzSumo came along. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/buzzsumo.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">BuzzSumo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> lets you put in a keyword and find out the most popular shared articles related to it. They aggregate shares across all of the major social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, LinkedIn, and Google+, then find the pieces of content with the most shares related to the keyword.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For instance, let\u2019s put in the word <em>freelancing<\/em>. BuzzSumo ranks articles by the total aggregate of social shares. At the top&nbsp;with 76,100 shares <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/brightside.me\/creativity-art\/15-brilliant-comic-strips-showing-how-freelance-life-is-different-to-an-office-job-238160\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">is a funny set of comics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about the differences between office life and the freelance life. Continue scrolling and you can start to get a sense of what is attracting people who read articles in this niche. By knowing what people are looking for and talking about, you can create content pieces related to those topics that can grab attention. You could reference the topics in your query letters, or write responses to them on your own social media channels. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just this feature would be enough, but BuzzSumo does so much more. It doesn\u2019t just find the top articles. It also finds the domains and the authors that have the greatest impact related to a keyword. In short, it\u2019s an influencer search engine. If you\u2019re looking for guest posting opportunities, this is a huge advantage. Why spend time trying to build your awareness with everyone under the sun when you could target the top ten people in your niche? You can even search for influencers directly by clicking the influencers link at the top of the page. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Want to track your own posts and influencer reach? That\u2019s done through their monitoring tool. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The free version offers you a glimpse into what BuzzSumo offers if you want to get an idea of how they&#8217;ll help you before you go all-in. In the free version, you get a few results and searches each day through the free interface. But even a single well-done search can reveal enough for you to see if this will be a good tool for your freelancing career.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A subscription to BuzzSumo is necessary to really start using the tool. That\u2019s where we can help. As part of our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/freelance-benefits\/Professional\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">membership benefits package<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, you can get a code for 30% off of a three-month subscription to BuzzSumo.
