And with aid relief packages taking longer than usual for governments to approve, many people are searching for answers on how to forge ahead.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThankfully, there are tons of insightful industry leaders that offer sound pieces of financial advice during these difficult times. Whether you&#8217;re a freelancer trying to weather the storm or a full-time employee wondering what you can do to make some headway, these 5 gurus can steer you in the right direction.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Brian Madgett, Head of Consumer Education at New York Life<\/h2>\n<p>Before making any drastic changes right away, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorklife.com\/newsroom\/financial-planning-madgett-five-things-americans-can-do?cmpid=smca_Bd_NA_na_1388891_na_na_na_CLPR_na_gen_ip_na_br\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Madgett<\/a> advises individuals to first re-evaluate their financial strategy.&nbsp;<br \/>\nPrimarily, this means taking a look at your current situation and re-tooling your finances to live within your means. Therefore, one should evaluate what their monthly expenses are, what amount of money they can pull in each month, and in what areas can they scale back spending to reinvest that amount into an emergency fund.&nbsp;<br \/>\nFor instance, if you typically spend $100 a week on eating out, put that routine on pause and sock that extra $100 away for anything unexpected.&nbsp;<br \/>\nGetting back to the basics is always a great way to assess your financial situation, and from there, you can make better decisions for the future.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/warren-buffett-says-finances-survive-170500933.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buffett offers a slew of financial wisdom<\/a> that anyone can benefit from. After all, he is a billionaire who has the magic touch when it comes to turning a profit. However, he also offers lots of practical know-how that people should consider.&nbsp;<br \/>\nEspecially during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the most important tips that Buffett offers is to clear any credit card balances as soon as possible.&nbsp;<br \/>\nOf course, it makes sense that consumers add to their credit debt in the midst of being strapped for extra cash from the pandemic, but sadly, the interest rates on credit are steadily increasing, which means you&#8217;ll most likely have to pay back much more than you initially owed.&nbsp;<br \/>\nAccording to Buffett, the best thing to do is to pay it off entirely or consolidate that debt into a loan at a better interest rate that you can handle. Perhaps once that second stimulus check comes in the mail, you can direct a portion of it (if not all of it) toward making a fresh start with any looming balances.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Marguerita Cheng, Certified Financial Planner (Letsmakeaplan.org)<\/h2>\n<p>Along with cutting interest rates for credit cards, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.letsmakeaplan.org\/blog\/view\/lets-make-a-plan-blogs\/6-personal-financial-planning-tips-during-the-covid-19-pandemic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marguerita Cheng<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014an experienced CFP<\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014suggests that the Federal Reserve has slashed interest rates on mortgages, which can be a great place to save some dough.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, interest rates have been dropped substantially for homeowners. And it doesn&#8217;t matter if your current interest rate only drops by half of a percent<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014the change can still save you upwards of thousands of dollars if you refinance.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Cheng also offers that it may be a good time to consider shortening the length of your loan, too. By refinancing and decreasing the term of your loan, you can reinvest those savings back into your home, pay off the loan quicker, and then wind up saving more money down the road.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Low-interest rates won&#8217;t last forever, so it&#8217;s best to strike while the iron&#8217;s hot.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Mariel Beasley, Duke University&#8217;s Common Cents Lab<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/select\/how-to-budget-during-coronavirus\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In a recent interview with CNBC<\/a>, Mariel Beasley of Duke University&#8217;s Common Cents Lab<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014a behavioral science lab centered around financial success for low-income individuals<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014took the time to share some valuable insights around budgeting.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\nOut of her top three suggestions, one of the best to consider is your &#8220;budget cash outflow vs. your cash inflow.&#8221;<br \/>\nEssentially, you want to think about your current income on a &#8220;per-spend basis.&#8221;<br \/>\nFor example, consider how many times you need to get gas in between each payday and then set aside a budget for each individual trip<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014not throughout the whole month.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">With that understanding, if your monthly gas budget is $160, and you typically stop for gas 4 times throughout the month, then try sticking to a $40 budget per trip. Maybe one week you end up driving less and only spend $20 on gas. Or perhaps you decide to carpool with a friend that week. In any case, you&#8217;re cutting your larger budget into micro budgets that will help stretch your dollar further from paycheck to paycheck.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\">Brian Menickella, Co-Founder of The Beacon Group Companies<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"fr-style\">Personal financier<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span>Brian Menickella<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span><\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/brianmenickella\/2020\/05\/01\/6-financial-tips-for-surviving-covid-19\/#2b1d093c7825\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">contributed an article to Forbes in May of 2020<\/span><\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"> with some excellent financial tips for anyone trying to survive the COVID-19 landscape.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Although much of his advice is geared toward investors, the best insight he has to offer for the average working professional is to take advantage of 0% credit cards.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Now, don&#8217;t be alarmed.&nbsp;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\nOther schools of thought mentioned here advise you to stay away from credit card debt, but with initial annual percentage rates (APR) at 0%, and with generous cashback offers or rewards, using a credit card can be a great way stay afloat financially until the economy bounces back to normal.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Apply These Principals to AND.CO<\/h2>\n<p>Now, everyone&#8217;s financial situation is different, but with these 5 principals, you should be able to create a strong foundation to help you support any potential pitfalls.&nbsp;<br \/>\nWIth <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AND.CO<\/a>, there are plenty of tools to help take these tips a step further, too.
