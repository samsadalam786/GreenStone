Translate your creative passions or area of expertise into a freelance business using these simple tips.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Identify Your Hard and Soft Skills<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your skills can be categorized into two groups\u2014and both are equally important. Hard skills are technical in nature. These are measurable, quantifiable and, in most cases, learned from <a aria-label=\"training or experience. (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/online-digital-marketing-certifications-freelance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">training or experience.<\/a> They include things like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>data analytics<\/li><li>website design<\/li><li>cloud architecture<\/li><li>computer technology<\/li><li>social media content<\/li><li>photography<\/li><li>search engine optimization<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/start-freelance-writing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"writing (opens in a new tab)\">writing<\/a><\/li><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"translation (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tomedes.com\/translator-hub\/ultimate-guide-freelance-translation.php\" target=\"_blank\">translation<\/a><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soft skills are more interpersonal, and describe how you relate to other people and tackle the rigors of a job. These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>motivation<\/li><li>teamwork<\/li><li>leadership<\/li><li>time management<\/li><li>communication <\/li><li>problem solving<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both hard and soft skills need to be \u201cworking in concert with one another,\u201d says <a aria-label=\"Laura Wilcox (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nazbeheshti\/2018\/09\/24\/are-hard-skills-or-soft-skills-more-important-to-be-an-effective-leader\/#3ec05adf2eb3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Laura Wilcox<\/a>, from Harvard Extension School. She says soft skills help you think more creatively about how to best use your hard skills.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make a list of both types of skills in two columns and consider how you can use them together to run a successful freelance business. For example, if you have web design skills and work well on tight deadlines, you could attract clients that pay more for quick-turnaround projects.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Consider Which Skills Are Money-Making<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you pinpoint your hard and soft skills, decide which ones can be used to start your freelance business. This stage in the process will likely focus more on hard skills, like writing or web design. For example, if you\u2019re a talented writer, you can get paid work writing for websites, publications, blogs and other forms of media. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, as a freelancer, you are the product, suggests <a href=\"https:\/\/ceo-project.eu\/training\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/M4.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Creative Entrepreneurs Online (opens in a new tab)\">Creative Entrepreneurs Online<\/a>, which means your skills are the vouchers for establishing credibility and boosting conversion rates, especially as you build a reputation for yourself. Choose to focus on the skills that really allow you to shine as the expert. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that soft skills can still be valuable if you plan, for example, to start a virtual assistant business. This type of work requires organization, motivation, and a take-initiative attitude. Don\u2019t downplay the value of these skills if they make sense for your interests and career focus.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related<\/em>: <a aria-label=\"These are the most in-demand freelance skills right now (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/top-freelance-skills\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">These are the most in-demand freelance skills right now<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Add New Skills to Your Current Arsenal<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may need to expand and diversify your skillset to be competitive in your industry as a freelancer. For example, you may be familiar with Google Analytics, but being GA certified will make you look a lot more appealing to a company who needs help with data. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To decide what extra skills you need, browse through listings on sites like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fiverr (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/fiverr.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fiverr<\/a> for jobs you\u2019d want to get. See what credentials they ask for. Conversely, look through freelancer profiles to see what training and skills they have. When you know what you need to level-up, you can seek <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"training from online courses (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/online-digital-marketing-certifications-freelance\/\" target=\"_blank\">training from online courses<\/a>, industry conferences, and certifications. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Consider Pricing<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing is crucial for making a freelance business last. You have to be competitive without selling your experience and talent short. Conversely, pricing too high will keep you from getting your first customers. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the best pricing to start with, do competitive research. Again, you can look through profiles on sites like Fiverr to find service-based freelancers who have similar skills and experience as you. If you want to sell products, like courses or ebooks, research on sites like Etsy or Amazon. Use this as a starting point and then let your pricing evolve as your business does.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related<\/em>: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-price-your-freelance-services-for-more-revenue-and-less-headaches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"How to Price Your Services for Increased Revenue and Less Headache (opens in a new tab)\">How to Price Your Services for Increased Revenue and Less Headache<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Find and Connect with Your First Client<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To get your first client, turn to friends and relatives who may want to support your new venture. You can even give them a discount for being your first client; remember, this is a learning opportunity for you as well. Ask in person, or post a status on social media, asking if anyone is interested in your services for a discounted price. As you do that, continue looking for other clients. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few other ways to connect:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Develop contacts on <a aria-label=\"LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a>, or the network most used by your ideal customer, by reaching out directly and posting regularly about topics relevant to your target audience.<\/li><li>Attend local networking events, which allow you to reach a wide range of people in-person. <\/li><li>Email websites, blogs or internet startups to see if they need contract services. <\/li><li>Sign up for freelancing websites and apply for gigs, or wait for potential jobs to invite you to interview.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>6. Create and Develop Your Brand Identity<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To continue finding and driving clients, you need to develop a clear, definitive and recognizable <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-freelance-invoice-template-breaking-down-what-you-can-customize\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"brand identity (opens in a new tab)\">brand identity<\/a>. Consider the brand to be your business\u2019s narrative\u2014the human impression you leave on customers when working together. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want your brand to feel both memorable and personable because \u201cbrand identity\u2014one with a face, trust and a mission\u2014attracts people who agree with what your brand has to offer,\u201d explains <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/agency\/develop-brand-identity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"HubSpot (opens in a new tab)\">HubSpot<\/a>. They continue, \u201cOnce these people become customers, that same brand identity gives them a sense of belonging. A good product generates customers, but a good brand generates advocates.\u201d <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the main areas to take into account when <a aria-label=\"developing a brand identity (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/taking-your-personal-brand-to-next-level\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">developing a brand identity<\/a> for the first time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Consistency:<\/strong> From logo and website to the color scheme and typeface of your marketing materials or <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-freelance-invoice-template-breaking-down-what-you-can-customize\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"invoices (opens in a new tab)\">invoices<\/a>, all elements of your brand need to be uniform across the board. This makes it easier for customers to distinguish your business from others whenever they come across your brand online. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Personality: <\/strong>Customers want to engage with brands that are human and drive an emotional response. This comes through in the words you use and your messaging. Ask yourself: Is my brand spirited and quirky? Refined and upscale? Sharp and witty? Bold and assertive? This will help refine how you talk with customers and what your messaging conveys. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Authenticity:<\/strong> Whether you interact with customers through an email newsletter, social media comments, or over the phone, be authentic. A strong brand identity helps you create a story about who you authentically are. This sets you apart from competitors and is attractive to the modern consumer.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Turn Your Skills Into a Freelance Business<\/strong><br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Use these tips to start building a business that brings in <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/balancing-a-side-hustle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"a second stream of income (opens in a new tab)\">a second stream of income<\/a> or allows you to move toward a life with more flexibility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Work hard at this process, and you can build a thriving freelance business that allows you to make the most of your abilities and passions. <br><\/p>\n\n\n<p><!--vcv no format--><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Want to get started with freelancing but have no experience?
