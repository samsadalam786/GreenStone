Whether you and your partner set out on your nomadic journey together or you\u2019ve met someone along the way, you now have a big decision to make: Do you continue with your nomadic lifestyle as you start a family, or do you return to your home country (one of them, at least) to a life of \u201cnormalcy?\u201d<br \/>\nFrom this point forward you\u2019re not just making decisions for yourself. You have to think about what\u2019s best for your growing family.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s a big responsibility.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 62\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">I\u2019ve been living in Indonesia for six years and have a daughter who is almost two years old. Here is my take on the highs and lows of being a parent away from your home country, and how to juggle parenting with remote work.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 63\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h4>Family Support<\/h4>\n<p>If you choose to raise a child in a foreign country, you\u2019ll most likely be doing it without the hands-on support of your extended family. Facebook and Skype are great for keeping in touch, of course, but they are no substitute for having someone there to look after the baby while you\u2019re on a big project or need to run a few errands. And by living far from your parents or in-laws, you\u2019re also forfeiting the bene t of cost-effective and trustworthy childcare.<br \/>\nThere have been moments when I wished my family was closer, but since this is the only style of parenting I\u2019ve ever known, I just get on with it. If you\u2019ve been traveling for awhile, you\u2019re probably used to adapting to new situations, anyway. Facebook does come into its own when it comes to connecting with other parents in your area. It\u2019s great to be able to meet up with nearby nomads to socialize, share stories, and offer support.<\/p>\n<h4>Balancing work time vs family time<\/h4>\n<p>One thing that attracts many to the freelance lifestyle is the flexibility it provides\u2014particularly when you\u2019re on the move. You can surf in the morning, enjoy a few beers in the afternoon, jump on a plane to somewhere new in the evening, and still have a sustainable income. This freedom and flexibility can be a mixed blessing as a parent. With no fixed schedule, it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re getting the balance wrong, either by neglecting your children, your work, or yourself.<br \/>\nIn the earliest sleep-deprived days especially, tensions can run high as you and your partner figure out how to distribute rest time, baby time, and work time. If you\u2019re both full-time freelancers, at least one of you will need to cut down your hours for a while. Make sure you discuss in advance about who that will be, and what your expectations are of each other as parents. If your work requires you to be online during certain scheduled windows, you\u2019ll also have to coordinate this with your partner. Babies sleep when they feel like it, not when you need them to.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h4>Family Healthcare<\/h4>\n<p>One of the things you care about most as a parent is your child\u2019s health. As a single nomad you may have laughed in the face of health or travel insurance, but that level of irresponsibility won\u2019t cut it as a parent. Giving birth abroad is one thing that worries many mothers-to-be. For me, it seemed like the obvious choice since I\u2019d made Indonesia my home and didn\u2019t want to be away for four to six months.<br \/>\nWhy so long? Well, it\u2019s not a case of just jumping on a plane, popping the baby out, and ying back again. First, airlines won\u2019t let you y after a certain point in your pregnancy. The limit can be anywhere from 28 to 36 weeks, so check your airline\u2019s policies before you book anything. Secondly, once the baby is born you\u2019ll need to get him\/her a passport, maybe two, and a visa for the country you\u2019re returning to if required. Since obtaining a passport can take weeks or months, you can\u2019t count on being able to leave by a particular date.<br \/>\nI know plenty of mothers who opt to move back home for several months so they can bene t from a familiar health care system and have their family close by. I also know many people who have stayed in Indonesia to give birth and have had no problem at all. Everyone has different needs and priorities, so you\u2019ll need to work out what\u2019s right for you.<\/p>\n<h4>Childcare and Education<\/h4>\n<p>Perhaps second to your child\u2019s health is their education. You might not worry about it straight away, but it\u2019s something you\u2019ll have to figure out as they approach school age. Education options include local schools, international schools, homeschooling, and unschooling. Which one you choose will depend on how settled you are, how much you can afford for school fees, how much time you have, and what your views are on education.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 64\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">If you don\u2019t like the idea of waiting four or ve years before getting back to \u201cnormal\u201d work, you\u2019ll need to think about either hiring<br \/>\na nanny or nding a daycare center. For me, having a nanny\u2014 although affordable\u2014was just too distracting. Shut away in my home of ce I could still hear what was going on and I was often interrupted. Instead, we found a local daycare center (which is way more affordable and exible than the nurseries marketed at expats) and my daughter has settled in really well.<\/p>\n<h4>Experiences and Perspective<\/h4>\n<p>It\u2019s easy to overlook the fact that letting your child grow up experiencing different cultures and countries is a great gift. It\u2019s<br \/>\nmore than just fancy summer holidays; they\u2019re living and adapting to different ways of life and learning what it means to be a citizen of the world. This is something that no expensive education can buy.<br \/>\nThe same goes for you as a parent. As a nomad, you\u2019re not limiting yourself to one culture\u2019s perception of how to parent. Even if you don\u2019t agree with everything you experience in other countries, you will likely encounter new ways of doing things that just make sense. Having this broader perspective empowers you to make more conscious choices about your parenting, leading to better choices for your child. And isn\u2019t that what being a parent is all about?<\/p>\n<article class=\"post-5595 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail category-digital-nomad entry\">\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 55\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 56\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 56\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 57\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"><em>Get tips on being a digital nomad from digital nomads in\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/setting-your-business-goals-as-a-digital-nomad\/\">our free eBook \u2018Anywhere\u2019.<\/a>\u00a0<\/em><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/article>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At some point in your life as a digital nomad you may start thinking about a family.
