It happens. It&#8217;s what makes us human, and also part-magpie. Freelancers work from home, satellite offices, coffee shops, and boardrooms. This ad hoc lifestyle can make staying focused a challenge. Don&#8217;t worry, Fiverr Workspace is here to help! We&#8217;ve compiled a list of six distractions all freelancers should avoid! (Reading this blog is educational and not technically a distraction, so you&#8217;re allowed to put down your work for a few minutes&#8230; we won&#8217;t tell!)<\/p>\n<h2>Pokemon Go<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>We get it. Our cities are overrun with small Japanese cartoon characters from our childhoods and it\u2019s our responsibility as citizens to catch them all. It\u2019s understandable that you might want to take a break from designing your client\u2019s new website graphics to head out into the fray armed with nothing but a Pokeball and rumors of a nearby <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pokemon.com\/us\/pokedex\/zapdos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zapdos<\/a>. However, looking for a rare fictional creature behind the dumpster in a back alley might not send the right message to your client. Head back upstairs to finish the graphic that\u2019s due at 5pm and holster those Pokeballs until the bell rings. You can catch as many critters as you want when you\u2019re off the clock. Just remember to look up once in a while!<\/p>\n<h2>Mr. Robot<\/h2>\n<p>Someone casually recommended that you watch <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/mQG644PY8O7rG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mr Robot<\/a> on Netflix, so you take a break from learning HTML coding and wander to the living room to cue-up the first episode. Six hours later, you realize you haven&#8217;t moved from the couch and it\u2019s the best thing you&#8217;ve seen since TV began. This scenario haunts most people with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Netflix<\/a> account and a show recommendation. Remember the days when all TV was rationed to once a week, and you had to move on with your lives during the days in-between? There is something to be said about waiting. For all of the stay-at-home freelancers, the \u2018Netflix binge\u2019 is harder to control. You have to be stronger, more focused, and more disciplined. Some might say that freelancers are the elite warriors in the battle that is &#8216;online streaming&#8217;. We ask you all to fight! Fight the urge to watch six episodes of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XWxyRG_tckY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stranger Things<\/a> back-to-back. Stride confidently into your home office, work on those overdue reports and treat yourself with one episode per day. Gain back some self-control and show the world how a freelancer goes to battle!<\/p>\n<h2>The Snack Room<\/h2>\n<p>Ah, the snack room. For those freelancers who get to work in fancy high-rise offices, coworking spaces, or companies that adorn their break rooms with ping-pong tables and beanbag chairs will no doubt face\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/cdn.decoist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/03\/Google-Amsterdam-Office-Kitchen-looks-like-a-scene-from-Alice-in-Wonderland.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Snack Room<\/a>. This room is filled with snacks and treats fit for a king, and it\u2019s all free. We know,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/eating-snacks-jz1iZxHbCwxSE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this is hard to resist<\/a>. How can you get anything done when you\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw from a jar of peanut m&amp;ms the size of your head, or a platter of strudels you can smell from the parking garage? Just remember, the food will always be there, so put your head down, finish the report and then you can fill your pockets with gummy worms and walk out having achieved something!<\/p>\n<h2>#TBT<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s Thursday morning and your Instagram feed is drenched in old sepia pictures of your friends and family from 1982. You\u2019ve got to balance a client\u2019s accounts by noon but all you can think about is whether to post the picture of you dressed as a dinosaur when you were five, or the one of you rollerskating down the driveway in cutoffs during high-school. We all love a good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=TBT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">throwback picture<\/a>, they remind us of a time without throwback pictures. But trying to find the best shot AND categorize your client\u2019s expenses\u00a0is not a great combination. You\u2019ll end up attaching a picture to your client&#8217;s profit report of that time you ate six cronuts, and posting a picture of their bank details to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Instagram<\/a>. No one wins in this situation.<\/p>\n<h2>Face Swap<\/h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0;\" data-instgrm-version=\"7\">\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\n<div style=\"line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 55.2778% 0px; width: 100%; background: #f8f8f8;\"><\/div>\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center;\">A photo posted by Jessica Anteby (@beigecardigan) on Feb 6, 2016 at 10:18am PST<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>The best faceswap ever created is of a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cosmopolitan.com\/lifestyle\/news\/a53465\/baby-oven-face-swap-help\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">child&#8217;s face<\/a> and the oven dials behind them. It\u2019s pretty fantastic. When you\u2019ve been working in your local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.starbucks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Starbucks<\/a> for over four hours, you start to wonder if your face would swap well with the coffee machine behind you. Better yet, can you get the receptionist at the start-up you freelance for to record a short video of your swapped faces and make it go viral for the day? This is all very productive stuff if you\u2019re an 18-year-old YouTube star generating revenue off this model, but you\u2019re most likely not. So get back to work and when you get home you can swap your dog\u2019s face with the fruit bowl until you pass out.<\/p>\n<h2>The World Wide Wormhole<\/h2>\n<p>Listen, we\u2019ve all been there. You were looking up the exchange rate between the Euro and the Dollar for a client\u2019s accounts, only to wake up an hour later, twelve layers deep into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wikipedia.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wikipedia<\/a> search on the history of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/fig-newtons-homemade-134577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fig Newton<\/a>. Another hour goes by and you\u2019re now in the final stages of buying heat-reflecting adhesive for your bedroom windows. It\u2019s very easy to get lost on the internet, but it doesn\u2019t look great when you\u2019re charging a client by the hour. Try to force yourself back to the task at hand and reward yourself with a 15-minute wormhole trip every few hours. After all, you can learn a great deal from diving into Google. Just make sure you avoid your ex\u2019s Facebook page, that never ends well.<br \/>\nAnd if you still find yourself tempted by these fun distractions, consider super helpful apps like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/freedom.to\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freedom<\/a>\u00a0as an affordable, efficient aide!
