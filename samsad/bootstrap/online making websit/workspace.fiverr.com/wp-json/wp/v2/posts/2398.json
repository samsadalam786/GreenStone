Amid hundreds of quasi-expired Indeed postings, dozens of LinkedIn messages and the occasional half-assed referral email from your former-CCO who has since wheeled his 32 CLIOs back home to Scandinavia, there is the occasional job description that looks too awesome to be true.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s a shame that these types of gigs can\u2019t be found in one place\u2014or better yet, delivered to your inbox at the same time every week, #amirite?
