There are the obvious and safe options, but you are neither of those things. Step up your client meeting by holding it in a fun and unexpected, yet (mostly) acceptable, spot.<\/p>\n<h2>Your Local\u00a0Coffee Shop<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Whether for an awkward first date or a casual job interview, the coffee shop is the gold standard for a neutral meeting spot. It\u2019s easy to see why. The swirling scents of bold roasts will lift your spirits. That one handsome leather sofa. The possibility that, when lobbed a difficult question, you can buy a couple of seconds by pretending your mouth is full of caffeinated gold.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The only things more ubiquitous than caf\u00e9s are the NGO canvassers that will post up in your favorite park this summer. But most of those joints will be chain franchises. While we\u2019re thankful that their presence means we can get a $7 Copa-Americana-Fettucino anytime we want, heading to one of them for a meeting isn\u2019t what anyone would call original. Instead, raise the stakes by suggesting a sit-down at an independent operation. It signals that you respect traditional expectations, but a local curveball shows you\u2019re willing to sidestep the obvious choices in life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>A Stroll in the Park<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The walking meeting isn\u2019t new. As President, Theodore Roosevelt would elect to go on long walks with staffers rather than meet in the office. Today, such a suggestion will raise heads, but will be welcomed all the same\u2014 especially when we spend all our time plopped in front of a computer. Everyone wants to stretch their legs.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In an office or formal meeting area, you\u2019re limited in what you can do and talk about. The moment you don\u2019t have a relevant comment or topical observation, the meeting is over. Outside encounters are a different ballgame. There\u2019s a certain encouragement to follow the natural pace of conversation, as you would experience with a friend. Lulls in conversation are natural, and when that happens you can just go with it. Take in the greenery around you, and give yourself some time to plan a follow-up question or idea.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pop-Up Gallery<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You\u2019re in luck if you live in or near a big city, where art galleries are abundant. These locations are perfect if you have a friendly rapport with your client because you can take care of business in a relaxed but sophisticated environment. A lot of them have vibe that is best described as \u201ccutoffs-and-crocs classy.&#8221; You can stroll into contemporary galleries looking however you want, so as long as you\u2019ve got the confidence to rock it. It\u2019s not as formal as most museums, and you can speak at normal volumes while guessing the prices of some of the far-out art of the contemporary scene.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Galleries, like a walking meeting, are notable because they give you a natural escape from conversation. The primary attraction is the art, so it\u2019s normal to stare intently at a paper clip and chewing gum sculpture while you think of a\u00a0new idea to share.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">One more thing: there\u2019s most likely free wine to be had. Make of that what you will.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Museum<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The gallery\u2019s straight-and-narrow cousin. If your meeting is going to be on the more formal side, but you still want to get the freedom to roam, a museum is the way to go. To make the most of it, pick a museum that you know like the back of your hand. Unlike galleries, which have art for sale, museums have their own permanent collections. So, you can keep things interesting by showing the client your favorite artifact or painting, and sharing a few fun facts about it. If you\u2019re super confident (and with Fiverr Workspace by your side, there\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\u2019t be), incorporate a private tour into your meeting. Bonus points if you can connect it back to the project at hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Go to See the Sports<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you and your client share a love of a particular sport, why not have some fun and go to a game together. Professional games can be pricey, but if the home team is struggling you can easily scoop up dirt cheap tickets. If the squad is are bringing your city some hard-earned hometown glory, why not look into minor-league or amateur events? If you\u2019re watching something like baseball, the leisurely pace of the game should facilitate an equally leisurely conversation. If they\u2019re fans of something more explosive, like football, you can gamble on the hope that the euphoric effects after a big play will tilt the meeting in your favor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Or Better Yet\u2026 Play One<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sometimes, egos are fragile. If you and\/or your client suffer from one, just stop reading and skip to the next suggestion.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are both up for a good time and working up a sweat, some competition could be what your meeting needs. Golfing has always been go-to in the business world. If you aren\u2019t down for teeing off with a client, check-up for a little one on one. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with bodying your client in the paint, maybe tennis or squash is more your speed. Or, spin the golf meeting on its head and set up a game of croquet instead. It will be just like Heathers, except you\u2019ll be discussing your creative output instead of how to be the worst possible person in high school.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Unexpected Vehicle You Happen to Have a License For<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Part of being a driven freelancer means that you are a lifelong learner. In the event you lifelong-learned your way to a pilot&#8217;s license, then take your client out for a ride. There\u2019s nothing like gliding along the sea while aboard <em>H.M.S. The Boat Formerly Known as the Artist Formerly Known as Prince<\/em> while renegotiating contracted deliverables. Take to the skies in your dirigible, and casually remark how you\u2019re one of only <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wired.com\/2014\/08\/piloting-goodyear-blimp\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">thirty-something blimp pilots in the world<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For the more traditional minded folks, hitch up the Hansom Cab and enchant your client during a magical evening ride. When you can complete your journey unscathed, they will never look at you the same way again. That&#8217;s a good thing.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019re a freelancer, there will be times where you need to meet with clients face-to-face.
