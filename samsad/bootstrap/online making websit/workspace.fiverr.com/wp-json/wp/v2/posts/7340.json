You might design websites. You might write blog posts. You could be a graphic designer, video producer, photographer, writer, or any number of other specializations. But there\u2019s one thing you\u2019re probably not \u2014 a salesperson.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many self-employed creators, sales is one of the most challenging, uncomfortable, and mistake-fraught hats they have to wear. It seems to require a certain set of skills, many of which run exactly counter to the traits that creatives often possess.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This puts freelancers in a difficult spot. If they want to scale to a six-figure freelancing business they need to focus on sales, the function they most dislike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. In <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/mike-montague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"his episode of the Six-Figure Freelancer audio course, Mike Montague (opens in a new tab)\">his episode of the Six-Figure Freelancer audio course, Mike Montague<\/a> dispels some of the myths around pitching and selling to high-ticket clients. With the right attitude and approach, you can close more high ticket sales and skyrocket your freelance business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sales Isn\u2019t About Selling, It\u2019s About Building Relationships<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We frequently think of salespeople as fast-talking hustlers that push customers into deals with aggressive tactics. And some do operate this way, but it\u2019s not the most effective way to sell. Prospects might buy from these people once to make them stop, but they certainly won\u2019t come back for more.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To land high-value clients that respect your skills and your time, you should take a very different approach. Instead of rushing to the sale, you need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/samanthaharrington\/2017\/05\/26\/how-to-create-strong-sales-relationships\/%23430266d6518d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"take your time and develop the relationship (opens in a new tab)\">take your time and develop the relationship<\/a>. Once you\u2019ve established a rapport with your prospects, selling becomes much easier, because customers buy from people they trust.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Build better relationships and create more open, honest communication than just trying to overhype your services. Generally the harder you push on prospects, the harder they push back and the more defensive walls they put up. Instead, just calm down, relax and create an atmosphere and environment where both people are equal. If you&#8217;re seen as a highly paid professional and worthy of higher dollars, more attention, more respect, then that&#8217;s what you attract and you get in the sales process.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Mike Montague, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Six Figure Freelancer audio course (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/mike-montague\" target=\"_blank\">Six Figure Freelancer audio course<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>You Need to Change the Way You Think About Your Business<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, you need to take yourself seriously. You need to believe that <a href=\"https:\/\/entrepreneur.com\/article\/218042\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"you\u2019re worth the money that you want to make (opens in a new tab)\">you\u2019re worth the money that you want to make<\/a>. This isn\u2019t always easy. Many of us are plagued with self-doubt, and often feel that we should accept whatever clients are willing to pay us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is the path to failure. It takes work and self-discipline, but if you want to close more high ticket sales you need to convince yourself that taking less than what you\u2019re worth isn\u2019t acceptable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involves shifting your approach to selling, from a position of weakness to one of strength. Yes, you need money. But you don\u2019t want to approach sales that way. Clients can sense desperation. If they feel you need the job, they\u2019ll have the advantage. So work to cultivate a mindset that says you want the money, but you don\u2019t need it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, you need to be willing to walk away. This moves the power in the transaction back to you, and it lends your position credibility. It says to your client, \u201cyou need me more than I need you\u201d, and only true professionals that know their worth approach their businesses that way. Your prospect will pick up on your confidence, and this is often enough to convince them that you\u2019re worth what you\u2019re asking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underbidding Can Actually Hurt Sales<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t the case with low-value clients that place price above all other considerations. But when you start pursuing clients that have decent budgets and are looking for quality, being the lowest bidder works against you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>I&#8217;ve lost the deal because I said I could do this website for 10 grand and I was $40,000 under the second, the next lowest bid. And so they said, hey, we like your work but we just don&#8217;t trust that you can do it. That deal&#8217;s too good to be true. And we&#8217;d rather pay for quality than get something cheap. So when you&#8217;re leveling up, sometimes you have to level up your money mindset too. And discounts are not deals for higher-level people. They have the money, they want something really outstanding.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Mike Montague, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/mike-montague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Six Figure Freelancer audio course (opens in a new tab)\">Six Figure Freelancer audio course<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the benefits you\u2019ll discover when you begin targeting higher-value clients. They\u2019re not afraid to spend money. They\u2019d rather pay higher prices to assure that they\u2019re going to get proper value in return.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So should you feel guilty that you\u2019re charging significantly more for the same work you did before? Absolutely not. If you can deliver what the client\u2019s looking for, and they\u2019re willing to pay a premium for that, then it\u2019s a win-win. Both of you get what you want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ride the Top of the Bell Curve<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For a freelancer, there\u2019s an ideal mix between the size of a project, the rate you\u2019re charging, and the difficulty involved in sealing the deal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the lefthand side of the curve, you have small projects for clients that won\u2019t pay a lot. These are minnows. They\u2019re are easy to catch, and the waters teeming with them, but you\u2019ll end up working crazy hours trying to close and finish the quantity you need to in order to support your business. This won\u2019t leave you any time to go after bigger fish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the righthand side of the curve are the whales. These are massive projects for large companies that pay handsomely. However, they\u2019re slow and lumbering, requiring a huge time investment to land. They\u2019re a boon to your bottom line, but their size will dominate your schedule, leaving you little space to take on other projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is dangerous because you\u2019re putting all your eggs in one basket. This leaves you financially vulnerable. If your whale were to ever head for different waters, it would leave a sizable hole in your revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top of the bell curve, right in the middle, is where you want to focus if you want to scale your business into the six-figure range. These are projects that have the budget to pay you a high rate but are still plentiful enough that you can keep your pipeline full of prospects. If one or two were to leave, it wouldn\u2019t affect your finances badly, and you wouldn\u2019t have a difficult time replacing them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keep Your Pipeline Full<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a game of numbers. If you only have five prospects, you\u2019re going to feel pressured to turn them all into sales. That means you\u2019re likely going to rush through the process and make mistakes. You\u2019re also more likely to accept lower rates in an effort to keep yourself busy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side, having a greater number of prospects allows you to focus only on the projects that get you excited, and those that are willing to pay you properly for your expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can certainly be difficult in the beginning, and it will require considerable effort marketing, prospecting, and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"writing proposals (opens in a new tab)\">writing proposals<\/a>. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you\u2019ve been working as a freelancer for a while, chasing minnows. Minnows don\u2019t talk to bigger fish. And bigger fish aren\u2019t impressed by the number of minnows you\u2019ve caught. In some ways, you\u2019re starting fresh when you move to scale your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once you\u2019ve established yourself, and you\u2019ve built some momentum, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/sales\/daily-habits-grow-sales-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"maintaining a pipeline brimming with projects (opens in a new tab)\">maintaining a pipeline brimming with projects<\/a> is significantly easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Build Momentum And Let it Snowball<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scaling your freelance business into the six-figure range takes a lot of work. And it can involve pushing yourself far out of your comfort zone. This is often enough to dissuade people from moving forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s important to remember that this level of engagement doesn\u2019t have to last forever. You just need to get the ball rolling. Once you\u2019ve closed a critical mass of larger, more lucrative clients, those clients can refer you to other clients. Working with these higher-tier accounts will establish your credibility in that space, making it significantly easier to close new work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once your revenues have ballooned sufficiently you can start outsourcing the parts of your business you don\u2019t enjoy. You have to work hard in the beginning, but once you\u2019ve built momentum, you\u2019ve created a positive feedback loop that can self-reinforce, as long as you\u2019re doing good work. Scaling your business requires less work over time, if you keep your momentum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>Those uncomfortable things are required, and you can either take a year to do the calls and the uncomfortable stuff and work, talking yourself into it. Or you can get all of that stuff out of the way in a month and get your momentum rolling and then you don&#8217;t have to worry about it anymore.<\/em><\/p><p><em>Mike Montague, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/mike-montague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Six Figure Freelancer audio course (opens in a new tab)\">Six Figure Freelancer audio course<\/a><\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is, how badly do you want it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn more about how to scale your sales in <a aria-label=\"Mike Montague\u2019s episode (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/mike-montague\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mike Montague\u2019s episode<\/a> of the Six-Figure Freelancer audio course.
