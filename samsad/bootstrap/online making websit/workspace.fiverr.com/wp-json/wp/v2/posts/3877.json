How\u2019s the water?&#8221; And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d<\/em><br \/>\nSpoiler: This is water. For the uninitiated, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this parable<\/a> shared by the brilliant David Foster Wallace perfectly portrays our collective tendency to get caught up in the frenetic whir of entrepreneurial life. We lose sight of the present moment and the simple, big picture realities that both envelop and drive us in favor of crossing items off an interminable to-do list.<br \/>\nIn the long run, this always-on mentality can cost us dearly in the form of missed opportunities and a-ha moments, productivity undermined by stress and lack of clarity, and the general ill effects of an unexamined life. With mindfulness resources and apps on the rise, there&#8217;s never been a better to time unplug your laptop and explore your approach to stress management.<\/p>\n<h3>Trend meets tried-and-true<\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to managing stress as an solopreneur, one of the most expedient tonics is a steadfast mindfulness practice. By now, this shouldn\u2019t exactly be news. Arianna Huffington makes a legit killing peddling the benefits of sleep\u2014why didn\u2019t I think of this?\u2014and meditation. Meditation and nap <del>rooms<\/del> pods are springing up in the offices of Silicon Valley, and I don\u2019t know, personally, whether I can stomach one more piece about a CEO who <a href=\"https:\/\/tmhome.com\/benefits\/ceo-meditation-successful-businessmen\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">swears by meditating<\/a> after their 4 a.m. workout each day.<br \/>\nThough it bears the hallmarks of a fad, scientific studies <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/inspired-life\/wp\/2015\/05\/26\/harvard-neuroscientist-meditation-not-only-reduces-stress-it-literally-changes-your-brain\/?utm_term=.569487a7d2af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">back up the benefits<\/a> of this ancient practice. Meditation brings about a cascade of measurable structural changes to your noodle, from reduced fight or flight response (you\u2019re unflappable), to increased empathy (you make your clients feel so understood), and improved memory and cognition (you have a <a href=\"https:\/\/i.giphy.com\/pzOOY2cCM7n6E.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">very good brain<\/a>).<\/p>\n<h3>Taking time to make time<\/h3>\n<p>So, how do you get started? For starters, save a space for silence in your day. No hippie-dippie vibes at play here; clarity and some of the best business solutions and ideas come from these quiet, solitary moments, so carve out time for this mental software update.<br \/>\nWe tend to\u00a0judge our careers on scale and quantity, versus quality and whether we have a sense of wellbeing\u2014and as freelancers, there\u2019s always a whole lot to keep track of. While we\u2019re not breaking out the patchouli, it\u2019s critical to mentally recalibrate, and consider the fact that more is not always better. Though it makes us feel we\u2019re doing \u201cenough,\u201d more action is not always more productive. Mindfulness can help keep intentionality at the core of your daily grind, and as a welcome by-product, help keep stress levels in check.<\/p>\n<p>There are so many ways to skin the mindfulness cat, allowing yourself the latitude to experiment is a solid first step. Give each strategy a bit of time to ascertain what works best with your routine. Read on to learn how mindfulness can fit into your approach to stress management:<\/p>\n<h3>The Mindfulness Starter Kit for Freelancers<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Attitude of Gratitude:<\/strong> Start the morning with a few declarations of gratitude, large or small. You might be grateful for a recent lucrative introduction, or you might take a moment to appreciate the simple glory of clear sinuses now that you\u2019ve recovered from that cold.<br \/>\n<strong>Device-Free Workouts:<\/strong> Combine the benefits of exercise with a clean mental canvas, devoid of the clutter of constant stimulation. Find another time to catch up on your podcasts.<br \/>\n<strong>Mini Meditations<\/strong>: set an alarm at regular intervals during the day to take a 1-2 minute break. Far from a disruption, you\u2019ll return to the task at hand with better clarity and focus.<br \/>\n<strong>Full Blown Meditation:<\/strong> in a perfect world, you\u2019ll detach from technology when you\u2019re getting your head right. In the meantime, any of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/advice\/5-apps-that-will-get-you-through-the-hectic-workday\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">these apps<\/a> will help structure your meditation for maximum benefits. Commit whatever time you can, even if it\u2019s five minutes.<br \/>\n<strong>Anxiety Triage:<\/strong> As stress or nerves build up, take a moment to focus exclusively on steady, deep breathing. It reduces adrenaline and will help alleviate symptoms of anxiety, restoring your ability to perform.<br \/>\n<strong>Bedtime Ban on Screens:<\/strong> Quality sleep drives quality hustle. At the end of your day, resolve to put the phone <a href=\"https:\/\/sleep.org\/articles\/ways-technology-affects-sleep\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">away<\/a> to allow your brain to transition to sleepytime.<br \/>\nAs a freelancer, you (and more specifically, your mind) is your product, your business and your livelihood. When it comes to stress management, a solid foundation can be built upon the incorporation of meditation and mindfulness in your day-to-day life.<br \/>\n<strong><em>How do you zen out to keep your brain fresh?
