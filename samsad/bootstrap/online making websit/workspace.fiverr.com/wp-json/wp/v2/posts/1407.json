Many freelancers prefer to eat out to save time, but even waiting in line to place an order can take up too much time in a busy crunch. What if you could zip in, zip out, and make it back to your home office or coworking spot just as quickly as snapping your fingers? <\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mealpal.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MealPal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lets you skip the lines for your favorite restaurants in six cities and makes it super-simple to order lunch. It is a meal plan service. You pay for a certain number of lunches each month, either 12 or 20. MealPal then lets you choose select dishes from restaurants in your area. Currently, you have to live in Boston, New York, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, or Washington DC. You place the order, then drive to the restaurant where it will be waiting for you. No lines, no worrying about tip, no worrying about price.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every city that MealPal services, you have at least 50 restaurants to choose from. \u00a0The number of eateries is growing all the time, too. \u00a0We wanted to give you a mouth-watering look into some of the restaurants that can have lunch ready for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Miami<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/cevichetown.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ceviche Town<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Would Peruvian Fusion impress that out-of-town client? Perhaps. This is one of the highest-rated restaurants on Yelp for downtown Miami.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/coldpressedraw.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cold Pressed Raw Kitchen<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Perhaps you\u2019re vegetarian and love to get your juice on? This restaurant serves vegan food and fresh juices. And if you still want that ceviche, the shroom ceviche is very popular here.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/el-taco-loco-de-la-8-miami\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">El Taco Loco<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Drop those sad burritos from Taco Bell and get some real authentic Comida Mexicana from El Taco Loco. Sink your teeth into a torta!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Washington DC<a href=\"https:\/\/www.alfapiehouse.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alfa Piehouse<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Greek pies aren\u2019t the usual thing you can find for lunch. But they make for a great and filling snack! If you haven\u2019t tried a Greek savory pie, you\u2019re missing out.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.masodc.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maso<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Sandwiches, salads, and smoothies. A good health food spot. Try the kale caesar with salmon.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/yafagrille.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yafa Grille<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Levantine food for the masses. All the hummus and shawarma you could ever want. One review described this restaurant as \u201cChipotle-style Middle Eastern.\u201d<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3>New York<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cafepatoro.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cafe Patoro<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Brazilian bakery and coffee shop. If you\u2019re a habitual coffee drinker, why not get an exotic pastry to go with your meal?<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gotannyc.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gotan &#8211; Midtown<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Think of a traditional coffeehouse, then make it upscale. That\u2019s Gotan. Several locations around the city. Known for their lattes and sandwiches.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.manousheh.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manousheh<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Greenwich Village, here is your Lebanese street food lunch spot. Try the zaatar and cheese combination. <\/span><\/h3>\n<h3>San Francisco<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/dabba-san-francisco-12\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dabba<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Asian fusion for your tastebuds. Try lamb tacos and hummus the next time you want to try something different by the Bay?<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/fayalasf.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fayala<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; This hot bar is best known for its catering and for its hot buffet bar at lunch time. You can skip the line entirely if you used MealPal.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paparikas.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paparikas<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Asian fusion of a different sort. Burmese is the main orientation. Ever try tea leaf salad? It\u2019s a standard snack!<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3>Boston<a href=\"https:\/\/bonapita.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonapita<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; One of those spots where they do just a few things but do them really well. Mediterranean food served fast (when you use MealPal, anyway.)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/flamecafeofboston.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flame Cafe<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Their kebabs may be just a dollar, but spring for the full eggplant dish at this Armenian cafe. You won\u2019t regret it!<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/?sk=h_chr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Piperi<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Mediterranean is really popular in Boston! Piperi is known for excellent food and a fast moving line. Plus, most of their dishes are customizable.<\/span><\/h3>\n<h3>Chicago<a href=\"https:\/\/www.chickenplanetchicago.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chicken Planet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; As it says on the tin, Chicken Planet is the place to go to get grilled chicken and sides. Get some pita bread and mashed potatoes to go with your half-chicken.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/herocoffeetraders.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hero Coffee Bar<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Lavender latte? Just give it a try and you\u2019ll be hooked.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/polpetti-chicago\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Polpetti<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; If you like your coffee and eats a little more Italian-style, Polpetti is the place to go. Have a meatball sandwich to go with your espresso.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re currently an AND.CO user, you can get 20% off of your first month\u2019s meal plan with MealPal.
