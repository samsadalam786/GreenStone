How people work is changing and there are many factors that play into the why, but if we look at how careers have developed over the years, we see that the current trend is just a natural evolution.<br \/>\nWhereas our parents stuck to a job for the lifetime of their career, the modern worker doesn\u2019t always commit to just one company.<\/p>\n<h3>The Slash Worker<\/h3>\n<p>People are increasingly diversifying their income sources. Contrary to prior generations, Slash Workers have shrugged the \u201csingle profession, single employer\u201d model in favor of building a portfolio of career opportunities for themselves.<br \/>\nTheir happiness comes from the ability to switch gears often, try different professions, and apply and learn a broader skillset. In turn this diversification gives them greater job security than their traditional one profession, one employer counterparts. If one job breaks away, the traditional worker is out of a job, but the Slash Worker has multiple legs to stand on and therefore will likely have a smaller risk of unemployment.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>From R\u00e9sum\u00e9s to Portfolios<\/h3>\n<p>In the past, we\u2019ve presented ourselves in form of resumes, which are a linear view on your past jobs and responsibilities, mostly highlighting the companies you\u2019ve worked for or the job title you\u2019ve held. The focus was on building a case for the length and quality of your professional experience.<br \/>\nFor a Slash Worker it\u2019s all about building a portfolio, which is a holistic view on your achievements. The objective is to tell a compelling and coherent story about your professional abilities, not stints, using anecdotes, data, referrals and actual work produced.<br \/>\nWhat has been a given in creative fields, will apply to all professions. The KPI is changing from \u2018who you worked for\u2019 to \u2018what you\u2019ve done\u2019.<\/p>\n<h3>From 9 to 5 to Project Based<\/h3>\n<p>Our parents had to clock in, clock out and job performance was closely tied to the time spent on the job. Most workers committed their time (generally 40 hours\/week) to the employer and had tasks assigned to be completed in set <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/topic\/windows\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">windows<\/a> of time.<br \/>\nEssentially, the worker traded personal freedom for predictable pay.<br \/>\nIn the Slash Worker economy, contracts center upon deliverables, not time spent. Workers commit to a specific output of work to produce over a mutually-agreed upon time period. Which leads to the worker gaining personal freedom, but for the potential of less predictable future work.<\/p>\n<h3>From Job Mind to Business Mind<\/h3>\n<p>For most people their career was just a series of employments. The worker was solely part of the structure of the organization. There was no reason for a designer to also be a businessman, because the organization took care of it.<br \/>\nA Slash Worker has to view their career like a business, one that has its own branding, positioning, phases, legal structure and clients, one of which can also be a full-time employment for a period of time.<\/p>\n<h3>The Slash Worker\u2019s Issue<\/h3>\n<p>Benefits and back office work used to be managed by the organization. The worker\u2019s job was to focus on their specialized area of work, and nothing else. In a world where the employee is committed to just one company, this model of managing workers was efficient.<br \/>\nBut when the worker is part of many organizations, not just one, this model starts to weaken. With less time spent per company, no company would want to take full responsibility for the worker and pay the appropriate taxes, insurances and materials.<br \/>\nIn the US, worker classifications were always constructed from the company\u2019s perspective, not the worker\u2019s. The difference in 1099 versus W2 is mostly on the employer\u2019s side. It dictates if the company has to pay taxes for the worker, and if the worker falls under certain protective labor laws that might make it harder or more costly to terminate the employment. Now, people are discussing if we should have a third worker classification. Simon Rothman of the VC firm Greylock said \u201cI think it\u2019s not 1099 versus W-2. I think the right answer is a third class of worker.\u201d<br \/>\nIn a modern career, a slash worker can hold multiple classifications at the same time. This is highly dependent on the company employing the person and the nature of the specific project. Therefore, <strong>many people won\u2019t just be one, they will be many<\/strong>.<br \/>\n<strong>The problem with the modern career is that it\u2019s more complex to handle than your typical full-time job.<\/strong> As your income diversifies across projects and partners, the admin work piles up. Suddenly, it\u2019s not just about the work you\u2019re doing, but also about how you structure yourself as a business. From your base setup to managing your day-to-day. Which leads to the fact that everyone will have to run their career like a business.<br \/>\nFrom a Slash Worker\u2019s perspective <strong>there should be<\/strong> <strong>just one worker classification<\/strong>, not many. That is where technology can help. New companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a> are working to create a system that eliminates the complexities of these classifications and their admin work\u2014a system that emulates how it would be if there is just one worker classification.<br \/>\n<iframe title=\"The \/Slash Worker\"
