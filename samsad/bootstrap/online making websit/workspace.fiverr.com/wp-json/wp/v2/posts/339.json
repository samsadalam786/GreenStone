You\u2019re used to playing the guitar, the drums, and the sax all while meeting your client\u2019s strict deadlines, typing away on some excel spreadsheet, and searching for your next big gig. It\u2019s that entrepreneurial spirit that is allowing you to succeed in your career goals. There are sometimes, though, when a potential new client doesn\u2019t like the sound of a one-person operation. Maybe that client has the bias that more bodies in a company means better work. Until they figure out human cloning (come on science!), freelancers will need to do <em>something <\/em>to close the deal with this type of a client, and the hardest time to do so will be during an in-person meeting. So, get your acting shoes on because it&#8217;s time to pretend to be a big company (while having an in-person meeting).<\/p>\n<h2><b>Freelancers can Delegate Tasks to Your \u201cAssistant\u201d On The Phone<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>When VIPs are in meetings, they have an abundance of power moves. One is picking up their phone while other people are watching to call their assistant and delegate tasks the VIP just \u201ccan\u2019t put on their plate right now.\u201d Why can\u2019t you, the juggling freelancer, do the same? Sure, you don\u2019t have an assistant but you do have the pizza place on speed-dial and they love to hear the voice of the one customer who calls just to say \u201chello.&#8221; Or, you can call your mom and leave her a voicemail that you\u2019ll have to explain later. She will love it because that means you\u2019re calling her twice in one day!<\/p>\n<h2><b>Recall Office Inside Jokes That Never Happened<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Nothing says office culture like inside jokes or stories that wouldn\u2019t be funny if you weren\u2019t forced to connect with your co-workers 40-hours a week until the end of time. So why not use that fact to show your new client you understand what it\u2019s like to work in a big company. Enter your in-person meeting laughing at something your funny co-worker \u201cJohn\u201d just did! Then let your chuckle fade and say, \u201cSorry, it\u2019s just my co-worker John this morning he meant to say \u201ctape dispenser\u201d but he said \u201cdape tipenser\u201d and oh man, the look on his face, oh man\u2026you had to be there\u201d.<br \/>\nThe story is so relatable and dumb that the client won\u2019t question a thing.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Bring Leftover Cake From An \u201cOffice Birthday Party\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Office birthday parties are both plagues and curses on the American workplace. As a freelancer, you might be missing out on free cake every now and again but you\u2019re not missing out on singing happy birthday to sometimes a gaggle of people not knowing whose name you\u2019re going to say first. As a freelancer, you can use this double-edge sword to your advantage. Stroll into your meeting and offer you\u2019re the client a piece of cake from an office birthday party. Not only will they be happy \u201ceating cake\u201d is now an agenda item for your meeting, they won\u2019t for a second believe you bought cake to pretend you work in a larger company than you do. That would be\u2026absurd.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Constantly Reply To Their Requests With \u201cLet Me Check With My Team\u201d<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Simple and easy, this is the gold standard for pretending you work in a bigger company than you do. Not to mention, it sounds like you have a \u201cteam.&#8221; Good for you. You are the boss in your small company, you better be the boss in your big company too.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Ask An Improviser To Play A Co-Worker<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Improvisation is best when you\u2019re playing with someone who understands the rules. You don\u2019t know what this new client is going to throw at you and you might have to do a lot of think \u2018em ups right on the spot! So why not take it a step further and show the client a real, live body to prove that you in fact have a co-worker! A skilled improviser will be able to jump on board with whatever way the tide is turning. And don\u2019t worry, you can find a skilled improviser easily. Improv is in fact, everywhere.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Come In With An Abundance of Bound &amp; Branded Booklets<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Sit down at the table with your new client, unload a number of bound and branded booklets, and apologize for all the \u201cstuff\u201d taking up the table. You can say something like, \u201cSorry, as I was running over to this very meeting my assistant handed me all this new reading material! There\u2019s a lot going on at the company!\u201d Nothing screams importance like bound and branded booklets. And if you need to fill those booklets, use your invoices and paperwork that <a href=\"mailto:https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/signup\">Fiverr Workspace can create for you if you become a member.<\/a> Just another thing Fiverr Workspace can do that you do have to worry about.<br \/>\nWith this list, pretending you\u2019re a part of a big company during an in-person meeting will go off without a hitch, especially if you feed the client cake.
