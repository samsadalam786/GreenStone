This doesn\u2019t bode well for you or your client, and it\u2019s an area that all freelancers can continue to improve upon.<br \/>\nHow do you measure your progress and how often are you checking in with these counterparts?<\/p>\n<h4><strong><em>1. Define your goals in detail<\/em><\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>We all want to make more money this year but how much of an increase are you striving for? Describing your goals in detail will help you determine the action plan needed to get there. Do you want to write for three top-tier publications? Which three lead the industry for your niche? Being general can pave a path that deters you from your end game.<\/p>\n<h4>2.<strong> <em>Create an action plan and set milestones to measure progress<\/em>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>An action plan breaks down the tasks needed to make your goal come to fruition. Pair this with reasonable milestones. Milestones are determined before the project begins, giving you reference points to chart progress. For example, if you\u2019re writing an e-book, an expected milestone would be the completion of an outline and the first two chapters by the two-week mark.<br \/>\nCoordinating this progress with your clients is a philosophy that varies, but it should always help either side become more informed. Whether it\u2019s allowing the freelancer get more familiar with the direction of the client or the client asking for an update\u00a0on a project timeline, providing information in a timely and constructive manner will help mould loyal customers.<\/p>\n<h3>Resetting goals for better results<\/h3>\n<p>Like most freelancers, I always feel pressed to accomplish more.\u00a0This feeling of urgency is common among solopreneurs, but it\u2019s also important to understand how to set new goals that help your career progress beyond the short-term. So, where do you see yourself in three months? In three years?<br \/>\nHow you approach these short and long-term goals should also align with where you intend to steer your career. All businesses and entrepreneurs should stick to one rule: Don\u2019t abandon what\u2019s working. If you\u2019ve been successful in helping tech companies with their content strategy, set new goals that will scale this kind of work. If you\u2019ve found more success creating social media content, set new goals that will broaden your reach with this service to offer.<br \/>\nAs you measure what\u2019s realistic, always strive to push yourself to continue expanding <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-you-need-freelance-community\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">your network<\/a> and career at an increasing rate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Focusing on making your work the best it can be is just one piece of the puzzle as a freelancer.
