The contradictory advice is nothing new. (Coffee will change your life! Coffee will end your life!) But it is still enough to make your head spin. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So what in the world is a creative entrepreneur to do? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It turns out there is no magic path to creative fulfillment, nor is there a singular secret to building a sustainable creative career. One solution just doesn\u2019t exist. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Thank goodness. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With plenty of options and plenty of potential solutions, we can all reflect upon exactly what it is we find most fulfilling and most motivating, and plan our careers accordingly. But that is more than a little petrifying. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Engaging in self-reflection means we might have to confront personal realities we\u2019d rather ignore, like the fact that we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">enjoy <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">having dinner with our children, or that we\u2019d rather <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">work less <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">instead of more. It might mean we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">prioritize stability <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and predictability over spontaneity at certain points within our career. It might mean we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">value what a \u201cday job\u201d provides <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">in terms of scheduling, benefits, and the chance to use a separate part of our brains. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We might realize those we hope to serve with our creative output aren\u2019t those who can afford to pay for our creative output. We might realize that we have absolutely no desire to mix commerce with our creativity. We might realize we don\u2019t mind networking so much. <\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jackiebattenfield.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Jackie Battenfield<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, author of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Artists-Guide-Make-Living-Doing\/dp\/0306816520\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Artist\u2019s Guide: How to Make a Living Doing What You Love<\/a>, <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">told me recently that a creative career always starts and ends with a person\u2019s goals. I couldn\u2019t agree more. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It would be considerably easier to outline a perfect path, a linear progression, through creativity. First, you pay your dues, then you meet someone magical, and then your secret work is discovered by the masses while you pretend to hate the attention. Then you win awards and accolades and never have to think about money again. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Except that dreamy \u2013 delusional \u2013 perfect path ignores what might really matter to you. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">That\u2019s why the goals matter. As long as you are making informed choices about your creative opportunities with intention, then you never have to apologize for your choices. You can explain why you made them and stand by them. <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cI love having a day job because otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t leave my apartment.\u201d <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cActually, I prefer to do something unrelated to my creativity while my brain sorts out a creative problem in the background. Parking cars as a valet is actually better for my studio practice than teaching.\u201d <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201cActually, I love teaching because I consider it new audience development; it helps me work out solutions to creative problems while it helps others learn.\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As long as you can figure out your goals, you can figure out how to mix and match the components of a creative portfolio career to reach those goals. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We like dividing the type of creative work we all do into three buckets: Starring Role, Supporting Cast Role, and Production Assistance work. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Starring Role<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your starring role is your \u201cthing.\u201d It is what you would do if you had unlimited amounts of time and money. It is what you think about when you have nothing else to think about. It is how you choose to make a difference in the world. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You may define your starring role very broadly or very narrowly; that\u2019s entirely up to you. But you know what your \u201cthing\u201d is. It is a close to your soul as you can get professionally. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Supporting Cast Roles<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Supporting cast role work is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">related <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">to your thing, but it isn\u2019t the thing itself. This work might be in the same industry (which enables you to build a community), it might enhance your technical skill set (thus benefiting your starring role). It might help you build a complementary administrative skill that will benefit your starring role. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your supporting cast roles are related to your starring role; they support your starring role with intangibles (networking, skill-building). But they aren\u2019t exactly the starring role. Supporting cast roles might include teaching at the college or community level, serving as a gallery assistant, ghostwriting, editing, tutoring, working behind the scenes in a museum, illustrating anatomy textbooks, or anything else that is close to your starring role\u2026 but not exactly the same thing. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Production Assistance Work<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Your production assistance work is the final category, and it is the least glamorous. But sometimes it is the most crucial. Production assistance work is temporary, repeatable, and stable, and you can return to it when and if you need to. Production assistance work doesn\u2019t benefit your starring role, other than providing income, scheduling stability, or benefits. Work in this category is the classic \u201cday job\u201d work we think about when building a creative career: Bartending, valet parking, dog walking, babysitting, waiting tables, or temping at a law firm. It isn\u2019t what we talk about when we talk about our work. (We focus instead on our starring role accomplishments.) But production assistance work can buy you time to let your starring role and supporting cast role work evolve organically. It can purchase you the freedom to pursue projects that move you toward your goals, rather than projects that will only help pay your bills. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Mixing and Matching<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are no rules about how to mix and match the types of work that may fall into any category, nor are there rules about which categories to include and which to exclude as you build your own sustainable creative career. There aren\u2019t even bright-line distinctions between the categories in many cases. This is simply a framework to help organize your thoughts and weigh your own strengths and your own goals against opportunities that might exist in the world. It\u2019s up to you to figure out what to do with that framework. Enjoy. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Within the past few weeks, I\u2019ve read articles about the value of finding a career you love, finding a \u201cvocation\u201d versus a \u201ccareer,\u201d and choosing to<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":35,"featured_media":8463,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16,17],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>What in the World is a Creative Entrepreneur to Do?<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"I\u2019ve read articles about the value of finding a \u201cvocation\u201d, and the contradictory advice is nothing new.
