The second where we realize something&#8217;s wrong, and we don&#8217;t have the tools to fix it ourselves. Client conflict can be as small as needing to correct a final draft, or as big as a misunderstanding over-scope.\u00a0It ranges from easily resolvable, to intricate and possibly contentious\u2014and that can make it scary to confront. But it&#8217;s not impossible!<br \/>\nClient conflict, like all conflict, is an issue of communication. And the medium of communication can make a huge difference when your goal is to solve a problem. So, when your next client conflict surfaces, use this guide when deciding how to reach out and seek a solution.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Client%20conflict%2C%20like%20all%20conflict%2C%20is%20an%20issue%20of%20communication.&#038;via=andco%20ammamarfo&#038;related=andco%20ammamarfo' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Client conflict, like all conflict, is an issue of communication. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Client%20conflict%2C%20like%20all%20conflict%2C%20is%20an%20issue%20of%20communication.&#038;via=andco%20ammamarfo&#038;related=andco%20ammamarfo' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><em>Text or email for:<\/em><br \/>\nDetail-oriented questions or changes<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all gotten a text message, personally or professionally, that we &#8220;heard&#8221; just a little differently than it was intended. Same goes for an email from a supervisor, co-worker, or collaborator. And that&#8217;s because text-based communication is a poor conveyor of tone. It&#8217;s an easy go-to method for its convenience and relative stability, but it&#8217;s also easy to hide behind because of this. That hiding can take a small issue and magnify it into a much larger issue in no time at all.<br \/>\nFor this reason, I reserve text or email as a communication tool for client conflicts that aren&#8217;t sensitive to tone. As an example, a &#8220;final&#8221; version of an article I wrote\u00a0came to me from my editor with a stray typo in it. I emailed back quickly to let her know where it was. That communication was one that wouldn&#8217;t be colored by tone\u2014a simple issue with a simple fix. The straightforward nature of written communication matches the black-and-white nature of these issues.<br \/>\n<strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> If you have common, small issues that arise, create email templates that you can plug in when the problem arises. That way, you won&#8217;t have to wrestle with the wording in the moment. The advanced planning will further prevent tone from coloring your communication.<\/p>\n<h3><em>Phone calls for:\u00a0<\/em><br \/>\nConceptual\/strategic questions<\/h3>\n<p>When I worked with students on a regular basis, my catchphrase was, &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as a quick\u00a0question.&#8221; Overwhelmingly, a quick question either (a) merited a bigger conversation, or (b) was a quick question\u2014but then merited follow-up questions. In either case, what seemed like a way to be polite, misrepresented the scope of the issue. I&#8217;ve been\u00a0in similar scenarios over email. A\u00a0&#8220;quick question,&#8221; ends up triggering a long back-and-forth thread. What could be solved on the phone in five minutes, instead turns into a protracted game of fact-finding tag.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s not always easy to pick up the phone and call. (This isn&#8217;t generational discomfort, by the way\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/nymag.com\/scienceofus\/2017\/02\/psychologists-explain-your-phone-anxiety.html\">lots of people have trouble speaking their mind this way<\/a>.) But when it comes to client conflict, I&#8217;d rather have a fast, clear conversation than sift through emails to find the answer to a question. This is particularly true when a project is unclear in concept or strategy.\u00a0Client-contractor relationships rest on the question: &#8220;What is this project designed to do?&#8221; And if the move you&#8217;re trying to make is essential to that question, I advise picking up the phone.<br \/>\nA caveat: It can be nerve-wracking to conduct conversations that affect scope without a record. I recommend two possible fixes for this. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/contract\/\">include a clause in your contract<\/a> about your client consenting to phone calls being recorded. Alternatively, you can follow phone calls with a summary email, detailing what you talked about and the action that will result.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Follow%20all%20client%20phone%20calls%20with%20a%20summary%20email%20detailing%20what%20you%20talked%20about.%20%40andco&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Follow all client phone calls with a summary email detailing what you talked about. @andco <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Follow%20all%20client%20phone%20calls%20with%20a%20summary%20email%20detailing%20what%20you%20talked%20about.%20%40andco&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<strong>PRO TIP:\u00a0<\/strong>Nervous about making your point on the phone? Write down some notes and key phrases you want to say before you make the call. This way, you can keep yourself on task and hopefully prevent the conversation straying away from you.<\/p>\n<h3><em>In-person or video chat for:<\/em><br \/>\nScope challenges or project termination<\/h3>\n<p>The goal is always for client conflict to be solvable, but sometimes\u00a0bigger conversations need to be\u00a0addressed. When these moments come, they should be faced\u2014literally. Conversations about a client-contractor relationship ending need to happen in person. As we&#8217;ve discussed, text and email fail to convey tone. If work conditions or expectations are untenable, that needs to be discussed in person. Phone, too, can be ineffective because body language and nonverbal cues matter. And while it may seem old-fashioned, there&#8217;s something timeless about looking someone in the eye in times of difficulty. Issues like mission or scope creep, timing of payments, or needing to walk away from a project all beckon that treatment. I include video chat as an option because the increasingly global nature of client-contractor relationships means in-person meetings aren&#8217;t always possible.<br \/>\nIssues that require an in-person meeting to resolve, often have been simmering for some time. They rarely appear without warning. As such, I&#8217;d recommend trying to address the problem with the other listed methods first. Big problems, particularly ones that result in termination, shouldn&#8217;t arise for the first time in person. This type of meeting should be a last resort, with several prior attempts at resolution prior.<br \/>\n<strong>PRO TIP:<\/strong> Include periodic checkpoints or project progress reports in your contract with your client. These check-ins should include updates on the project, as well as with the process of the project. If communication is lagging, resources are needed, or other problems exist, these progress reports should address that.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Client%20resolution%20%23protip%3A%20include%20checkpoints%20%2B%20project%20progress%20reports%20in%20your%20contract%20with%20your%20client%20%40andco&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Client resolution #protip: include checkpoints + project progress reports in your contract with your client @andco <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fguide-client-conflict%2F&#038;text=Client%20resolution%20%23protip%3A%20include%20checkpoints%20%2B%20project%20progress%20reports%20in%20your%20contract%20with%20your%20client%20%40andco&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Remember: Communication is Key<\/h3>\n<p>Client conflict is going to happen; it&#8217;s a risk that exists anytime we enter into a working relationship.
