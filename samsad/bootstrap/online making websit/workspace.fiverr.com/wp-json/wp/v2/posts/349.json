While most of the country now welcomes freelancing as part of the modern workplace new normal, some still don\u2019t quite get it. You can explain it any which way but they seem incapable of wrapping their mind around it like we do. Instead of seeing you as an independent, driven, business professional they see it&#8230;<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">differently<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t avoid these situations sometimes. So, here&#8217;s some freelance advice for you: when you\u2019re faced with these scenarios, embrace the proverbial chaos and show them the bright side of your career. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Grandma Who Can&#8217;t Stop Worrying<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gam Gam loves to worry. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To make sure that she\u2019s ready to take the life-altering news that you don\u2019t have a traditional job start by getting her comfy. Surround her with the items she loves: her cozy blanket from her childhood, that sweater with a bird on it and her favorite show. We can\u2019t guarantee this will totally change her mind about freelancing, but she loves you and you\u2019re making her comfortable. That alone should allow her to take the news better than the time your brother got that tattoo celebrating the anniversary of Lionel Richie\u2019s classic \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OdQDXs75Ulo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dancing on the Ceiling<\/a>.\u201d <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Conservative Grandpa<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a man who had the same office job for 37 years and still thinks Barry Goldwater should be President, explaining an office job might be tough enough for him, much less freelancing. To make it easier on him, offer to come over to watch the game. Which one? Doesn\u2019t matter. He watches them all. \u00a0If you\u2019re lacking in the sports banter, Google some facts to make it look like you\u2019ve actually been keeping up with the team. Man, that Tiger Woods sure knows how to dunk a fastball&#8230; <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enjoy a 6-pack of Schlitz over the next few hours. During a break in the action, he\u2019ll ask about work. By that point, the hardened exterior of gramps should have whittled down a bit. When he asks about work, keep it vague on specifics while highlighting how \u201cthe shop\u201d (Starbucks) is bustling and business is booming. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Significant Other\u2019s Dad<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An ex-Marine with an iron grip handshake, he has callouses on his callouses. This guy understands grit and hard work. When he asks you what you do, he might not understand what you mean. It\u2019s cool. He may not understand you, but he understands hard work and drive. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start by making plenty of references to \u201cthe office\u201d and \u201ccoworkers\u201d. Maybe he won\u2019t ask for specifics, but he will. This guy\u2019s career was built on specifics. That\u2019s why it\u2019s vital that you describe the corporate structure you have in operation. From having your own <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/freelance-life-before-and-after-having-an-and-co-chief-operator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chief Operator<\/a>, legal department and accounting team on your side, Dad won&#8217;t be able to find a bad aspect of your career choice. In fact, seeing his child dating a competent, thriving professional is likely to make him remember his baby child as a rapidly-growing, independent adult. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just don\u2019t mention the tear you notice rolling off his cheek.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your Significant Other<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your significant supports you but still doesn\u2019t totally get why you tour coworking spaces and can work at your desired location. It sounds great but they remain skeptical. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To drive home your correct career path to them, invite them over under the pretense of catching up on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.imdb.com\/title\/tt2442560\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Peaky Blinders<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. When they get to your apartment, surprise them with a candle-lit dinner of homemade (you ordered on Seamless) gnocchi. Get out that bottle of three-buck chuck and pour them a tall glass and, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OOPS,<\/span><\/i> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how did that Fiverr Workspace quarterly earnings report wind up on the table??<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You go to clean off the table but hesitate just long enough to see their eyes go wide as they see what you\u2019ve earned. It may not completely sway them over, but it should be a real good start. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when you find yourself stuck in these precarious circumstances with your loved ones be sure to highlight the awesome aspects of freelancing they might not understand just yet. With you in their lives, they\u2019ll soon understand that you\u2019ve made an awesome decision that millions are joining you in. All the best! <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today\u2019s modern workforce is more open to freelancing than ever before.
