Not only do deliverables need to be produced on time, but networking is key to being a successful freelancer, as is taking the time to continue to learn about their craft, as well as, of course, \u00a0keeping track of all client work and payments. Unfortunately, even the most organized of freelancers can still have issues with payment. Almost all freelancers have experienced the frustration of late payment or no payment for services. Until recently, they have had nowhere to turn when in such situations. It is for this reason that, on October 27 at 7:30pm, New York City freelancers will gather in Freelancers Union HQ, on the second floor of 408 Jay St., <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">for a party in support of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">support of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/get-together-and-support-freelanceisntfree-tickets-27027621343?ref=estw&amp;mc_eid=65bf5806b9&amp;mc_cid=a2359816f5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">NYC&#8217;s Freelance Isn&#8217;t Free Act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">There are millions of freelancers living in New York City, and over 70% of them have experienced issues with getting paid for their services. Many of them are forced to wait months for payment, or to accept a lesser payment than the agreed upon rate in order to get paid at all. Freelancers have to hire attorneys to fight clients who do not pay the full amount on time, however even paying for an attorney, which many cannot afford, does not guarantee full payment. Getting paid sometimes seems like an impossible feat, which is why <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/bradlander.nyc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">City Councilmember Brad Lander<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> introduced the Freelance Isn\u2019t Free Act.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelanceisntfree.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">stipulations in this act<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> are numerous. For example, any client who hires a freelancer for $800 or more must provide a contract that states the exact parameters of work, the method of payment, and the date the payment is due. No client can lower the amount of payment once the contract is signed, and the money must be in the freelancer\u2019s hands no more than 30 days after the date specified. Additionally, the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https:\/\/legistar.council.nyc.gov\/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2530972&amp;GUID=61F8754B-80AF-493E-895E-D6D17209776E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Isn\u2019t Free Act<\/a>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">protects freelancers from delinquent clients. If a client\u2019s actions go against what is stipulated in the act, freelancers can complain to the Department of Consumer Affairs, as well as file a court action against said client. The client may be responsible for paying double damages and attorney fees the freelancer incurs if the judge rules in the freelancer\u2019s favor as well and, if the freelancer wins the suit, the client may face fines.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The Freelance Isn\u2019t Free Act, if passed, would empower New York City freelancers to do their work without worrying about whether or not they will get paid what they are owed. It would rid the city of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gothamist.com\/2016\/03\/01\/freelancers_nyc_law_pay.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">stories of freelancing parents<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> who are forced to pull their kids from private school because they are routinely not paid what they were promised, and of freelancers who cannot pay medical bills because they have been waiting months for an outstanding payment of thousands of dollars<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/gothamist.com\/2016\/03\/01\/freelancers_nyc_law_pay.php\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In any case, the Freelance Isn\u2019t Free Act is a necessary step towards ensuring that freelancers are paid in full for their services. The <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freelancers Union<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> has for decades been dedicated to advocating for freelancers all over the United States. Membership is free, and it gives freelancers access to benefits, protections, events, and more. The Union listens to the struggles of their freelance community, which is how the Freelance Isn\u2019t Free Act came into being in the first place, and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">organizing a party in support of the campaign<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. They urge freelancers to join the fight to pass this act, not only because it will benefit freelancers who have not gotten paid for their services in the past, but because <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2016\/08\/17\/5-reasons-to-support-the-freelance-isnt-free-act-even-if-youve-never-been-stiffed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">it will benefit the entire industry<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. This act has the potential to prevent bad clients from hiring freelancers in the first place, as well as to increase the value of individual freelancers and to raise the standards of the freelance industry as a whole.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The party will be held on October 27th at 7:30 pm at the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps?q=freelancers+union+brooklyn&amp;rlz=1CASMAI_enUS711US712&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&amp;bvm=bv.135974163,d.cWw&amp;biw=911&amp;bih=411&amp;dpr=1.5&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipwvKcrOfPAhXSCD4KHbwmAIIQ_AUICCgD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Freelancers Union HQ in <\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Downtown Brooklyn<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.
