The promising payout fueled your late night creativity and you missed outings with your friends. You double fact-checked your references and uploaded the file with relaxed confidence. You really outdid yourself on this one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks pass without any response, and it starts to become painfully obvious that the promising payout will be delayed, if you&#8217;re going to receive it at all. And if that news wasn\u2019t deflating enough, you then realized you neglected to execute a freelance contract. Oh dear! What\u2019s a freelancer to do?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this is a frustrating scenario, don\u2019t feel bad. You\u2019re not the only one who has been in this position\u2014in fact, a huge <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-write-an-overdue-payment-reminder-letter\">71% of freelancers<\/a> have experienced non-payment challenges. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best thing you can do is learn from this experience, and put in place practices to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/advocacy\/guide-to-getting-paid\/\">avoid non-payment<\/a> from your clients in future. First and foremost, you\u2019ll want to get comfortable <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/3-strategies-for-writing-a-binding-freelance-contract\/\">using freelance contracts<\/a> in all of your transactions, which includes the clients you already know well. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6 reasons you should use contracts and agreements as a freelancer<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on the fence about whether it&#8217;s really necessary for you to use contracts, here are six compelling reasons to get yourself well away from that fence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Increase your professional image<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use freelance contracts, you convey to others that your creative work is not a hobby. It\u2019s a business and your clients should value your craft and your time as much as you do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a contract, you communicate your commitment to delivering on your promises. Just as you\u2019re protecting your interest by using a freelance contract, you\u2019re also being held accountable to completing the work as ordered by your client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Make the terms clear from the outset<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms of freelance work are as diverse as the freelancers who set them. Using freelance contracts in your business allows you to clearly state your terms. Such as, how many revisions do you offer? Do you require a down payment? How will the work be delivered? What happens if the customer isn\u2019t satisfied with the finished work?<br><br>You can spell out your terms in the contract to be sure you\u2019ve left no important stone unturned. Your repeat customers will expect consistency in your terms and in your work. That\u2019s a good thing!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Eliminate misunderstandings<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, a conversation about your services could start in a chat and end with a telephone call or email. For this reason, you\u2019ll want to use a freelance contract to finalize any communications that may have occurred outside of the contract to avoid misunderstandings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s good practice to include verbiage in your contract that states something along the lines of: \u201c<em>Only the written contract represents the agreement between you and your client<\/em>.\u201d A clause to this effect is included in the free freelance contract template created by The Freelancer&#8217;s Union and Fiverr Workspace.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Use it as a branding opportunity<br><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>How you present your business to the public impacts the quality and quantity of the work you attract. Your freelance contract, invoices, and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\">proposals<\/a> are more than sheets of paper. They are a part of your branding strategy, making you not only look professional but also making your name and logo more recognizable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invest in your brand by creating invoices, proposals, and freelance contracts that work to your marketing advantage. The good news is you don\u2019t have to break the bank to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-freelance-invoice-template-breaking-down-what-you-can-customize\/\">make a great impression<\/a> with your business forms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr Workspace from Fiverr<\/a> offers attractive proposals, contracts and invoices for freelancers who want to streamline their billing and invoicing while creating their unique brand message. With these beautiful forms, you can share your brand at every phase of the business transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>6. Avoid costly omissions<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you rely on your client\u2019s contract, you risk having some of your important terms omitted. For example, you may have a particular term that states how revisions are handled. Using your own freelance contracts protects your interest and your valuable time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Getting started with freelance contracts<br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Still have your doubts about using freelance contracts? Don\u2019t overthink it. Our lives are inundated with contracts and agreements. You can\u2019t download an app these days without first accepting the terms of use. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider viewing a freelance contract as a way to clarify your conversation\u2014to make sure all parties understand and agree to the terms of the work to be performed and how it will be delivered. With your payment much more secure, you can focus less on <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/demand-letter\/\">chasing up invoices<\/a> and more on the things you love to do\u2014like creating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read More:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/freelance-contract-clauses\/\">Essential Clauses in Your Freelance Contract Template<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A simple template to use<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many boilerplate contract templates that you\u2019d find on the Internet, contracts for freelancers have a unique language. The Freelancer\u2019s Union and Fiverr Workspace put together a template contract to help you get started. As you further define your unique offerings and terms, you can use this template as a guide to creating your own personalized freelance contract.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, it\u2019s not what was said over the telephone, it\u2019s what\u2019s in writing that will hold up in court. Let\u2019s keep you out of the courtroom and at your virtual desk, creating incredible work for your clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hands up if you&#8217;ve ever experienced this: You were hired to create web copy [or insert relevant project here] for a client.
