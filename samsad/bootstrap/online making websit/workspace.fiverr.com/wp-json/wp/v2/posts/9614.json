In other words, how do you scale your freelance business without burning yourself out?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll outline some of my best advice based on over a decade of working with and coaching freelancers and solopreneurs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Build systems and processes<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since your time is limited (and valuable), you want to make the best out of it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can start by automating your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/new-freelance-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sales processes<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are solutions for everything\u2014from prospecting to outreach and follow-up\u2014you can set up automations or workflows that will make your life easier and increase your freelancing ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology solves this for you, and you don\u2019t necessarily need to be a tech genius to achieve it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coolest thing about this approach is that you can transfer it to almost every area of your business. You can:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Transform and adapt your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/thefearlessfreelancer.com\/new-client-onboarding\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">onboarding processes<\/a>&nbsp;so your clients get started smoothly (and without a ton of effort on your end).&nbsp;<\/li><li>Improve your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/project-management-software\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">project management systems<\/a>&nbsp;to get more stuff done and deliver everything on time.<\/li><li>Optimize your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/guide\/setting-up-invoicing-system.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invoicing and finance management processes<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;get paid and track revenue.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are just some ideas to get you started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With some creative thinking, you can cut on a lot of costs and time-consuming tasks, giving you more time to work on activities that make you money.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Say \u201cNo\u201d more often<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you say \u201cyes\u201d to a project, you shut the door on many others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same rule applies to every task you perform when running your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saying \u201cyes\u201d to non-revenue generating tasks will cut into your ROI fast.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pause for a second, what services do you sell as a freelancer? Are you a marketer? How many hours do you dedicate to do marketing for your clients? What do you do with the rest of your time? What are some other tasks you perform every day?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember your time is limited, so you need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/balancing-act-multitasking-strategies-for-independent-professionals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use it wisely<\/a>. Say \u201cno\u201d to projects you know won\u2019t be profitable or may get in the way of more important tasks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create your own rules of thumb about which tasks are worth your time or not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be selective with your time and the projects you work on. I know it\u2019s hard to say \u201cno,\u201d especially when you are just starting, but as your business grows, you\u2019ll be able to say \u201cno\u201d more often.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The faster you learn to say \u201cno\u201d to tasks that drag you down, the faster your ROI will skyrocket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Stop charging by the hour<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re charging by the hour, you start with very limited inventory.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s because there\u2019s an obvious limit to the number of your own hours you can sell\u2014making it next to impossible to improve your ROI significantly if you\u2019re charging by the hour.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, when you&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.lifehack.org\/articles\/money\/you-should-never-charge-hourly-rate.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">charge by the hour<\/a>,&nbsp;you\u2019re actually punished (your ROI goes down) when you become more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you do things faster, better, or more efficiently, your earnings will decrease because you\u2019re billing fewer hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ouch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/maximize-freelance-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">increase your profits<\/a>,&nbsp;you need to get away from hourly billing and start charging by the project or by the value you give to your clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, try setting a fixed price for each service you offer, and stick to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do that, then more efficiency will mean higher profits and better ROI.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also bring other benefits: you won\u2019t have to negotiate on hourly rates anymore and you will also be able to \u201cproductize\u201d your offers, meaning you\u00a0can\u00a0treat your service like a product.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a basic offer to sell to all your clients will cut a lot of costs, because you won\u2019t have to create a custom proposal each time, price it out, and adapt your processes for every situation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Measuring your ROI<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To make progress on improving your freelancing ROI, you have to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/melissahouston\/2020\/08\/24\/why-its-so-important-that-you-should-know-your-business-numbers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">know your numbers<\/a>. That is, you have to know exactly how much you make each month and how much you spend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by listing all of your service costs and subtracting them from your revenue.&nbsp;This may sound very basic to some, but you may be surprised at how many people did this exercise and found hidden costs they were ignoring.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have those numbers clear, it\u2019s time to make decisions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eliminating non-revenue increasing costs is an immediate boost to your ROI as a freelancer.&nbsp;You can also choose to increase your prices by revamping your offer, adding more value, etc. Or you can also build processes that cut down your time, effort, and costs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are just&nbsp;starting out as a freelancer&nbsp;or if you have freelanced for years, measuring ROI consistently should be a core part of your business. As ROI goes up, you&#8217;ll be better prepared to scale your business and build revenue you can rely on every month.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a freelancer, your most important asset is time.
