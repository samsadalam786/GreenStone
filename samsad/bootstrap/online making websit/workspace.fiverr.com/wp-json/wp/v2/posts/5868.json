And if I come across a client who needs design help, I refer them to one of my trusted colleagues.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forming an alliance with someone in your own field is another way informal partnerships can help you grow your business. Such alliances have enabled me to take on projects that are larger than I can handle on my own. Bringing in another person with experience that&#8217;s similar to or complements my own has also allowed me to go after larger clients that might hesitate to put a project into the hands of a solo freelancer.<\/span><br \/>\n<strong>Related: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-reasons-why-your-freelance-business-isnt-growing\/\"><em>5 Reasons Why Your Freelance Business Isn&#8217;t Growing<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b>Making alliances work<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My personal experience with alliances has been 95% positive. In fact, I have several alliances that have lasted decades. But I\u2019ve seen many colleagues and clients enter into alliances only to be deeply disappointed with the results. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A copywriter friend entered an alliance relationship with someone she had known for years. But since they weren&#8217;t clear\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">about each other\u2019s expectations, the result was a disaster&#8230; especially for my friend who lost existing freelance clients in the process.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\nSo how can you reap the benefits of alliances and decrease the potential for things going wrong?<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips on how to get it right from the beginning.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Learn how the other person conducts business and treats clients<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tendency when talk turns to forming an alliance is to focus on how well your service offerings match up with those of the other person. But if you don\u2019t ensure from the start that you have the same attitude toward how to conduct business and how to treat clients and customers, you\u2019re in for a world of trouble.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the first topics you need to discuss with a possible ally is your objectives for your businesses. Listen carefully to how the other person talks about their clients. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do they seem to value their clients and enjoy working with them, or do they say negative things about them? Do they seem to put the interests of their clients first? Are they committed to delivering the best work possible or do you get the sense that they try to nickel and dime their clients? Are they conscientious about deadlines or do they tend to treat them lightly?<br \/>\nIf the business habits and attitudes of a potential alliance partner don\u2019t match yours, walk away quickly. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re going to face an endless series of arguments and may even end up harming your business reputation if people begin to associate you with the bad service provided by your ally.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Find out about the clients of your potential partner<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things I enjoy most about freelancing is the freedom to choose my own clients. Depending on how close an alliance you form, you may be giving away some of this freedom. If you\u2019re going to be working with the existing clients of a new ally (and not just going after new clients together), you want to make sure you\u2019ll be comfortable with these clients.<br \/>\nOver the years, I have delved into referrals I received from an alliance partner only to find out they were in no way the type of person I\u2019d want to work with. In one memorable instance, an ally referred me to someone who wanted help in writing a business book; a quick internet search revealed that this would-be client was a convicted felon who had served time for chicanery in his former business \u2013 in other words, not someone anyone should be taking business advice from. My ally knew this but didn\u2019t think it was a big deal! If your potential ally has any dubious characters on their client list, you\u2019ll want to know about this in advance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Try baby steps first<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dipping your toe in the water with a small joint project instead of going headlong into announcing to the world that you\u2019re entering a major alliance is often the best way to go. This gives both of you a chance to see how the other works with clients and to judge whether their skill level matches what they claim to have. If you find problems, you can either figure out a way to address those or bow out of the alliance. This will save you the embarrassment of having announced an alliance only to have to acknowledge shortly thereafter that it didn\u2019t work out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Put key points in writing<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This should not need to be said, but, alas, from my observations of others, it is advice that is frequently ignored, to everyone\u2019s later regret. Going through the exercise of putting in writing the key points of an alliance is very helpful. While you may not be forming a legal partnership, you still will benefit from putting down the key points, especially those related to money and responsibilities. And, of course, if you are forming a legal partnership, then make sure you have all your paperwork ducks in order on that front before moving forward.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a freelancer, you&#8217;re always looking for new ways to grow your business.
