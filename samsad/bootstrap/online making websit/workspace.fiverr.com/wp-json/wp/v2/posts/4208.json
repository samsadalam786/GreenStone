While you\u2019re hustling to build up a list of clients to make sure that you can pay the bills, you should also be simultaneously working on various marketing materials to help you close deals with said clients. An air of professionalism in the way you present your business can be the difference between getting the job, or losing out to someone who takes their branding efforts a bit more seriously.<\/p>\n<p>The following represent some of the most important marketing materials you\u2019ll need when you start working for yourself. Don\u2019t feel like you need everything at once, but instead, use this as a to do list of sorts to be constantly chipping away at. The better you can represent your business through these various marketing materials, the more trust you\u2019ll build at the beginning of a potential deal, and the more likely you are to win the client.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fworking-11-marketing-materials-youll-need%2F&#038;text=Represent%20your%20%23business%20with%20these%2011%20marketing%20materials.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Represent your #business with these 11 marketing materials. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fworking-11-marketing-materials-youll-need%2F&#038;text=Represent%20your%20%23business%20with%20these%2011%20marketing%20materials.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nAs some of these things build on each other, you\u2019ll want to first start with the important foundational elements before getting into the more complicated pieces.<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>Elevator Pitch<\/h2>\n<p>An <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2012\/08\/win-the-business-with-this-ele\">elevator pitch<\/a> is the least expensive (free, in fact), but most important marketing piece you\u2019ll need when working for yourself. Practice talking to somebody about what you do in one minute, then 45 seconds, 30 seconds, and challenge yourself to be succinct in just 15 seconds. You\u2019ll need some version of your elevator pitch for your website\/portfolio and social media profiles, so it\u2019s important to work on this before you get there.<br \/>\nWhile you\u2019re at it, take the time to define your target audience in the form of one or multiple marketing personas. It\u2019s important to do this before anything else on this list, because it will inform almost anything you do on behalf of your business. Hubspot\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.makemypersona.com\/\">MakeMyPersona<\/a> tool can help to jumpstart and simplify the process.<\/p>\n<h2>Logo<\/h2>\n<p>Your logo helps to brand professional materials as \u201cyours\u201d and will be used on anything from your social media profiles, to your website, contracts, invoices, and more. With\u00a0Fiverr Workspace you can simply\u00a0add your own logo to your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invoices<\/a> so you&#8217;re representing your brand at every touchpoint. If your budget is limited, purchase a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/categories\/graphics-design\/creative-logo-design?source=category_tree\">basic logo<\/a> from a seller who\u2019s work you like on Fiverr. Or, if there\u2019s a graphic designer in your network, propose a trade of services. Win-win!<\/p>\n<h2>Business Cards<\/h2>\n<p>Despite numerous articles claiming that \u201cbusiness cards are dead!\u201d there\u2019s a greater camp of people who would vehemently disagree. Many freelance jobs operate over the internet, but there\u2019s definitely still room in the offline version of society for the exchange of business cards. The following situations represent ideal situations to be carrying business cards, instead of struggling to find a pen and paper:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A local networking event<\/li>\n<li>Meeting new people: whether expected or unexpected (like on the train)<\/li>\n<li>At a family gathering. Your family might ask for some to give to friends who need your help!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vistaprint.com\">Vistaprint<\/a> is an excellent entry-level option for the printing of various promotional materials you\u2019ll need when working for yourself. Their standard offering for business cards is 500 for $9.99.<\/p>\n<h2>Branded Stationery<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re already putting in an order for business cards, why not knock this piece off your marketing materials to do list at the same time? Don\u2019t underestimate the power of snail mail, and the ability to use it to stand out from other freelancers vying for the same job.<\/p>\n<p>Using your business&#8217;s logo, or a monogram of your initials, to create some simple branded stationery\/cards to use for all occasions. For example, if you\u2019re meeting with a potential new client, follow up with a thank you card. Or if a client is going through a hard time, send your condolences on your branded stationery. You may want to purchase custom cards for big holidays like Christmas, but if you\u2019re short on time just use your branded stationery!<\/p>\n<h2>Headshots<\/h2>\n<p><strong>You need headshots. <\/strong>This is non-negotiable. If you are working for yourself and operating an online business, people will want to see who you are. A smiling face that acts as your avatar will instill a level of trust in you that\u2019s infinitely greater than Twitter\u2019s default egg or LinkedIn\u2019s default grey silhouette.<br \/>\nHeadshots are <em>not<\/em> glamour shots. And they don\u2019t have to be expensive! Use a little bit of savvy to keep your costs down if you have a limited budget:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attend a networking event with a photographer offering mini sessions.<\/li>\n<li>Scope out local coworking spaces with frequent events. Some bring in photographers for headshot sessions.<\/li>\n<li>DIY with a plain background, a neat\/professional appearance, and the help of a friend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A professional can help you get the best results, but if all else fails, make it happen on your own. You\u2019ll need a headshot for your social profiles, the about page on your website, author bios on guest posts, and so much more that you won\u2019t realize until the situation presents itself.<\/p>\n<p>And while you\u2019re at it, consider the power of <strong>video<\/strong>. Smart online entrepreneurs are realizing that using video on their website and social channels can be an excellent way to gain favor with potential clients. The more of your personality you can show through content creation efforts, the easier it is for a person to imagine themselves working with you. No need for expensive production equipment or fancy editing, the built-in tools on your computer will do just fine.<\/p>\n<h2>Document Templates<\/h2>\n<p>As you win new clients and go through onboarding, you\u2019ll start to recognize the need for certain documents and processes that could be standardized to save you time. The following represent document templates every freelancer will want to create:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/contracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Contracts<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Invoices<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Proposals<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>When you start working for yourself, you won\u2019t need these documents immediately, but it will certainly help to have them ahead of when you need them! Quick tip: Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">app<\/a> has all of these features in one spot.<\/p>\n<h2>Email Signature<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re working for yourself in an online field, you\u2019ll be sending a lot of emails. A detailed email signature represents the perfect opportunity for passively marketing yourself to anyone you come into contact with, whether you\u2019re pitching them or not.<br \/>\nA great email signature contains the following components:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headshot<\/li>\n<li>Name\/Title<\/li>\n<li>Phone number (if you\u2019re not comfortable sharing your direct number, consider setting up another through <a href=\"https:\/\/voice.google.com\">Google Voice<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li>Links to relevant social profiles\/your website<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wisestamp.com\/\">Wisestamp<\/a> is a dynamic option for creating an email signature that allows you to easily display your latest blog post and other useful pieces of your online identity. Plans start at $6\/month, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.appsumo.com\">AppSumo<\/a> has been known to offer lifetime access for less than $50.<br \/>\nAnd just like an email signature is an online billboard of sorts for every email interaction, you might also want to consider passively advertising what you do offline through a branded t shirt, baseball cap, or hoodie.<\/p>\n<h2>Social Profiles<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the services\/products you offer, it\u2019s not necessary to be on every social platform. But it\u2019s worth your time to create a consistent strategy on <em>at least<\/em> one or two of the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Linkedin<\/strong>: necessary for cultivating professional connections.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Twitter<\/strong>: a platform for building thought leadership and networking within a certain industry.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Instagram<\/strong>: best used only if you have a lot of visual content to share. It\u2019s not a super high converter if you\u2019re looking for traffic, but potential client connections are known to happen here at random.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Facebook<\/strong>: almost everyone looks here for your business and it\u2019ll be important to start building an audience\/content if you eventually run ads. Take this opportunity to install a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/help\/952192354843755\">Facebook Pixel<\/a> on your website, which will come in handy for future retargeting efforts.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google+\/Google My Business<\/strong>: Establish a Google+ profile <em>no matter what f<\/em>or incremental help with SEO. Complete a Google My Business profile if you\u2019re a local business, to help local patrons find you.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pinterest<\/strong>: With the right approach, this social bookmarking website can be a huge traffic generator.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>While you\u2019re at it, develop some daily themes and image templates to help with the process of content creation. Consistency is key to success.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fworking-11-marketing-materials-youll-need%2F&#038;text=Consistency%20on%20social%20media%20is%20key%20to%20%23personalbranding%20success.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consistency on social media is key to #personalbranding success. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fworking-11-marketing-materials-youll-need%2F&#038;text=Consistency%20on%20social%20media%20is%20key%20to%20%23personalbranding%20success.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Email Newsletter<\/h2>\n<p>You may not be ready to send out an email newsletter yet, but you should take some time to lay the foundation for it. Enable signup forms on your website\/social media so that you can start collecting emails. Then, work on a basic template for future email sends. You\u2019ll be glad you started the list building process early on.<br \/>\nAnd while you\u2019re messing around with your website, take the opportunity to install <a href=\"https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/analytics\/web\/\">Google Analytics<\/a> to help you measure all of these marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelance Job Sites Profiles<\/h2>\n<p>Getting work from <strong>Upwork<\/strong> or <strong>Fiverr<\/strong> is <em>not<\/em> a long term strategy for success, but it can be a short-term strategy for paying the bills and building up your portfolio. So when you\u2019re just getting started working for yourself, take some time to create a complete and engaging profile on your platforms of choice. For example, adding a video to each Fiverr gig can increase the number of people ordering it, even if you\u2019re just getting started on the platform.<\/p>\n<h2>Website\/Portfolio<\/h2>\n<p>This piece is one of the most important and one of the most procrastinated on the list of marketing materials people when working for themselves. Depending on the type of services\/products you offer, your website can take on many forms.<br \/>\nSome options include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress (industry-agnostic)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/contently.com\/\">Contently<\/a> if you\u2019re a writer<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/\">Behance<\/a> if you\u2019re a Designer<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/\">Github<\/a> if you\u2019re a developer<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shopify.com\/\">Shopify<\/a> if you\u2019re selling products<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And if you opt for a website over a portfolio building tool, make sure to create content\/functionality for the following standard pages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearedomino.com\/learn\/freelance-marketing\/40\/How-to-write-an-effective-professional-bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">About<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Blog (optional, but useful)<\/li>\n<li>Services\/Work with Me<\/li>\n<li>Contact<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Working for Yourself: 11 Marketing Materials You\u2019ll Need<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by all the marketing materials you\u2019ll need to put together when you start working for yourself, that\u2019s completely understandable.
