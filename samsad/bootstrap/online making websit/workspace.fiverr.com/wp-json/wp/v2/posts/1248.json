If you\u2019ve ever had to use business lines inside of a corporate building, you\u2019ve used one. It\u2019s a way for multiple people to share phone lines using extensions while still keeping one main number. This lets businesses use a single number for outside contact. It\u2019s more convenient and it helps them look more professional.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Can freelancers do the same thing? Not usually. Freelancers often have to use their personal numbers to talk with clients or use a generic VOIP solution like Skype. While Skype is an accepted method for business communication, it\u2019s not as professional as a traditional phone line. Skype also has problems if you need rapid phone communication between multiple parties at any time. It\u2019s much easier for your client to call your sales department directly via an extension rather than looking through a directory listing. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s not easy for freelancing teams either. Sometimes a call is better than an email, but who wants to keep track of 5 or 10 (or more) phone numbers for each contractor? Shouldn\u2019t we be able to simulate a PBX system using the cloud by now? The answer is yes.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.grasshopper.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grasshopper<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is a telephony solution for freelancers and remote teams that bring together the advantages of a PBX system through the cloud. Here\u2019s how it works. You link a front-facing telephone number with Grasshopper. This can be a personal number or it can be a toll-free number. You can use one that you already have, or order one through Grasshopper. You can even create a vanity number to help your customers remember you better.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you have a number linked with the system, you record a greeting message that your clients will hear when they call you. You can also use several professional standard greetings made by their voice studio, or even commission Grasshopper to make a custom greeting just for your business. After that, you can add extensions to Grasshopper much like a standard PBX system only without complicated programming. You can have single digit ones leading to departments as well as three-digit ones that go directly to a person. When you have to call a client, you can use the Grasshopper app to contact them so they won\u2019t know you\u2019re calling from a personal phone. This raises your level of professionalism.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Grasshopper also allows other PBX features. When someone calls your number, you can answer it, send it straight to voicemail, or look at the caller ID. If they choose to leave a voicemail, the software can create a recording and a transcription and mail it to you. You can also receive faxes (great for contracts) and even send business SMS messages. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To get this sort of functionality in a standard business environment would be quite expensive. PBX systems and software aren\u2019t cheap. But Grasshopper is quite reasonable, and we\u2019d like to give you a chance to try it out. On our <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/freelance-benefits\/Professional\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Member Benefits<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> page, you can find a coupon code for $75 off of a Grasshopper purchase. That\u2019s enough to give you at least a month of Grasshopper service. By the time you finish it out, you\u2019ll know whether or not Grasshopper is for you.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re struggling with juggling phone numbers or you want to present a more professional appearance over the phone, give Grasshopper a try over the next month.<\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever heard of a PBX system?
