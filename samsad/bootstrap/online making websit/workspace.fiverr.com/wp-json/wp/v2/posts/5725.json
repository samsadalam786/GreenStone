But while the freedom and flexibility that comes with the job are envied by many, there are also some unique challenges when it comes to<\/em> real life <em>remote work. Here we talk to String Nguyen, a content creator and influencer turned startup founder, to discover how she makes remote work work for her.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Where\u2019s your homebase?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the internet? Can that be the answer? I\u2019ve been travelling extensively, but I feel most at home in Melbourne, Australia. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What do you do for work?<\/strong> <\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m working on my startup, TasteMaker ProStack. It\u2019s to help influencers monetise their creativity, cred and community. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Tell us a little about your remote work journey. When, how, and why did you get into it?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My journey started when I became a live streamer on Meerkat. That moment 4 years ago, allowed me to build my community and network around the world. First, I went to San Francisco, but I\u2019ve been able to build my brand through channels like conferences and organising fried chicken parties. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So far, I\u2019ve visited over 25 cities in 10 different countries. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">My latest win is building a LinkedIn video channel. As a content creator and marketer, I became an influencer, which allows me the freedom to geek out with the smartest peeps in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Is remote working what you imagined it would be? Why\/why not?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No, lol. I had to develop discipline as you can easily get distracted by the new food, people and culture. I set up a process and system to allow me to work and focus &#8211;&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/feed\/update\/urn:li:activity:6333190397556293632\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like using virtual assistants and delegating them research or grunt work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But set times to chill too. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working on building my own star<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tup while working remotely, I actually have to rethink if this is sustainable. For now, I travel to meet with partners and investors. Having a strong team that supports my vision has allowed me to continue to travel and work remotely. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Biggest challenge with working remotely?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time. I talk to different people in different time zones. I had to hire a personal assistant to be my time magician. If you become a bottleneck in your business, develop a process or delegate. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What does it take to be successful as a remote worker?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ability to focus and be self-disciplined. You also need strong accountability and communication skills.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What\u2019s something you learnt the hard way?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again it\u2019s about time. Travel logistics can be a nightmare and you need time to recuperate, otherwise it will impact your work. Health and sleep should be a thing to consider when you\u2019re working remotely.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>What advice would you give to companies or employers who are working with remote employees?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re starting the remote program, be prepared to make mistakes at the start. Set up realistic expectations and encourage open communication and a feedback loop. I do think flexible and remote working continues to be on the rise. Want to know more? Google \u201cFuture of Work\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/anywhere-workers\">Our recent Anywhere Workers study<\/a> found that \u2153 of remote workers have trouble shutting down at the end of the day. Do you have any tips for maintaining a work\/life balance when working remotely?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start small, set boundaries. I\u2019m on the phone a lot. During dinner time, I put my phone away from the table and be present with my friends and loved ones. Encourage others to do the same and set phone etiquette.<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Want to learn more about what it&#8217;s really like to work remotely?&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>According to our recent&nbsp;Anywhere Workers study,&nbsp;remote working is growing in popularity.
