For example, perhaps you&#8217;ve been active on social media for months or years but no clients or revenue have come from it. Considering eliminating your social media presence.\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A simple way that I like to determine these tasks is to have a regular practice of reviewing which tasks I should stop, start, or keep doing. Data is extremely helpful for these reviews. Having an understanding of what percentage of time you spend on tasks versus how much impact they have for your business makes it really easy to stop working on tasks that may otherwise have felt difficult to let go of.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, automate anything that doesn&#8217;t need to be done by a human (more on how to do this in a moment). <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, Widmer says you should \u201cdelegate anything that can&#8217;t be eliminated or automated. For example, if you need to create content, send\/answer emails, or do any other task that needs to be done by a human but doesn&#8217;t need to be done by you, hire a VA to do this for you.\u201d <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if a task truly must be done by you, because it&#8217;s your area of expertise\u2014the thing you specialize in that makes you very high dollar per hour income\u2014then do that yourself. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to constantly review, question, and push the boundaries of what you need to do personally. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>9 Things You Can (and Should) Automate in Your Freelance Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the things that can (and likely should) be automated in your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-01-03-at-5.02.12-pm.png\" alt=\"using automation to promote yourself, social media automation\" class=\"wp-image-6116\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1.

And that\u2019s what you get with <a href=\"https:\/\/meetedgar.com\/\">MeetEdgar<\/a>. The fact is you shouldn\u2019t have time to post to social media every day, and even if you do, there\u2019s a good chance a large portion of your audience won\u2019t see what you post. MeetEdgar holds onto and categorizes your old posts and reposts them when you can\u2019t, giving more people the chance to read the brilliant things you say and helping you post more often.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a free solution, <a href=\"https:\/\/buffer.com\/\">Buffer<\/a> has a free version that will allow you to schedule a bunch of posts in one go, so you don\u2019t have to constantly check back to social media (a distraction waiting to happen). You can even schedule it to post during your sleep so you can reach clients on all time zones.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-6123\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Discovering-opportunities.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\n<h4><strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Automating\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Client Prospecting<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Finding new clients is the lifeblood of a healthy, expanding freelance business.

As an example, if you\u2019re a writer you might set up an alert for \u201ctechnical writing\u201d and \u201chiring now\u201d. Google will alert you via email whenever it finds an opportunity matching those criteria. Get creative.
