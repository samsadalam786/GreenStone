But before you spend all your time and effort scrolling through job boards, focus your attention on maximizing your word of mouth (WOM) potential. A recent\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-freelance-economy-still-runs-on-word-of-mouth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a>\u00a0found that 75 percent of solopreneurs get their work through connections and networking.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re an introverted type who shudders at the thought of\u00a0receiving an industry cocktail mixer invite, then the word \u201cnetworking\u201d might sound like a nightmare. Instead of panicking, remember you\u2019re that you probably know a lot of people already. And that they know even more people. And that you can find new clients through that tangled web of connections instead of at a designated event or over a series of coffee meetings.<br \/>\nSo, how do you leverage the power of the people?<\/p>\n<h3>Maintain your own client database &amp; keep it fresh<\/h3>\n<p>Go back in your career history, even back to internships, and make a list of the relevant people who might be valuable to connect or reconnect with. If you\u2019re uncomfortable\u00a0sending a cold email, shoot them an add via LinkedIn, and then initiate a conversation once\u00a0they\u2019ve accepted your request. Tell them what you\u2019ve been up to, that you\u2019re looking to expand your client-base, and\u00a0explain your services in the context of their needs.<br \/>\nBe specific in this outreach. If you&#8217;ve worked with them before, explain how you might partner again to help them meet their objectives. If they are a new lead, providing concrete examples of some of your recent work and how it relates to their own business goals. Give prospects a reason to respond by making it about\u00a0<em>them<\/em>, not you.<br \/>\nBe prepared for responses that indicate no need for your services, or poor timing. Instead of hanging your head, make yourself a note (better yet, set a calendar reminder) to follow up in a month.\u00a0Don\u2019t be afraid to ask whether your contacts know of anyone who may be interested in outsourcing assignments.. The worst that can happen is they say no, in which case, keep moving down your list!<\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t ignore friends and family<\/h3>\n<p>Mixing your personal life and your business life isn\u2019t always a good call\u2014especially when money\u2019s involved\u2014but asking your circle of trust to hook you up with the members of their squad (or co-workers, gym buddies, hairdresser, whoever) comes with fewer complications.<br \/>\nIn these cases, it also helps to provide concrete examples of your work. Provide your immediate connections with a brief rundown of your skillset or preferred areas of interest so instead of them saying \u201cI know a writer,\u201d (and who doesn\u2019t?) they can advertise your expertise and argue your case. Plus, letting them know what type of clients you\u2019re hunting for will get their brains running through a mental rolodex in search of relevant contacts and keep their eyes peeled for any possible targets that come their way. Just make sure they have your contact info on hand so you don\u2019t miss out on any opportunities due to a case of \u201clet me check with them and I\u2019ll get back to you\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Use social media to network<\/h3>\n<p>Not only is social media an effective way to make new friends and expand your social life (even if it\u2019s all online), it\u2019s also a useful tool for buddying up with people in your field or who may need your help in the future. The more you interact with the same people, the stronger your ties will become and your initial GIF\u00a0thread might evolve into a business partnership or lead to opportunity hand-offs. And don\u2019t underestimate the power of a middleman tagging you in a comment on another person&#8217;s post\u2014if a potential client or employer knows and trusts your mutual connection, then they\u2019ll have a reason to look at your resume first.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-freelancers-can-maximize-their-word-of-mouth-potential%2F&#038;text=Don%E2%80%99t%20underestimate%20the%20power%20of%20a%20middleman%20tagging%20you%20in%20a%20comment%20on%20a%20post.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Don\u2019t underestimate the power of a middleman tagging you in a comment on a post. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-freelancers-can-maximize-their-word-of-mouth-potential%2F&#038;text=Don%E2%80%99t%20underestimate%20the%20power%20of%20a%20middleman%20tagging%20you%20in%20a%20comment%20on%20a%20post.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Be bold on\u00a0LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>LinkedIn&#8217;s recent updates are making it easier than ever to find new connections around existing conversation threads and topics. Embrace the randomness! If someone sends you a request and they seem like a potential client fit, embolden yourself to send them a message\u00a0and continue the conversation. This might result in absolutely nothing, or it might result in a whole new world of opportunities. Either way, it can\u2019t hurt to try.<br \/>\nFinally, the thing to remember when it comes to networking and using word of mouth to expand your business is that you\u2019ll never know who\u2019s friends with who and who does what until you ask. Does that translate to bombarding everyone you meet with questions about their career and their connections? Of course not. But it does mean that you shouldn\u2019t sit back and wait for people to come to you. Keep your portfolio and resume polished, invest in business cards, and get ready to introduce yourself.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Leveraging your network is a surefire way to grow your freelance business and grow your client base.
