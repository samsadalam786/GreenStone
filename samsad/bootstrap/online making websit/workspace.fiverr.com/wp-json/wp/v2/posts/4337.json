From finding time to market your business to dealing with the inevitable income roller coaster ride, being self-employed isn&#8217;t always a walk in the park.<br \/>\nWhat\u2019s one of the biggest roadblocks you need to overcome time and time again? Actually getting a\u00a0freelance job\u00a0(and, you know, earning a paycheck).<br \/>\nConsidering that <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2016\/07\/20-surprising-stats-freelance-economy.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one in three Americans<\/a> classify themselves as freelancers, there\u2019s a lot of competition out there when it comes to finding new clients and landing new jobs\u2014meaning that standing out and adding that project to your to-do list can become all the more difficult.<br \/>\nWhether you\u2019re applying for a posted role, bidding on a project, or sending a cold email, you need to be prepared to make yourself stand out (preferably in a good way\u2014and not in an \u201cemail that prospective client twice a day every day until they respond\u201d sort of way).<br \/>\nSo, how exactly can you do that? How can you help yourself get a freelance job? Well, nobody would know better than the people at creative agencies who actually hire freelancers. I chatted with them to get some insights into what makes them want to reach out to a potential freelancer\u2014as well as what makes them want to run far, far away.<\/p>\n<h3>The Do\u2019s<\/h3>\n<p><b>1. Know your personal brand<\/b><br \/>\n\u201cFreelancers with an authentic, relevant, and cohesive personal brand often stand out from the crowd,\u201d says\u00a0Diane Domeyer, Executive Director of The Creative Group, a creative staffing agency. Domeyer explains that this includes your visual identity\u2014think your business cards and your website\u2014as well as your verbal identity, like your elevator pitch and resume content.<br \/>\nFiguring out your personal brand can feel sort of intangible. But, Domeyer has a simple tactic that can help you gain some clarity on what sorts of things you should be emphasizing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cA good way to nail down your personal brand is to create a one-page brief on yourself,\u201d she says, \u201cThis exercise forces you to craft a targeted message based on your skills, qualifications, passion projects, accomplishments, and career aspirations.\u201d<br \/>\nShe recommends getting started by listing everything you have to offer a potential client, and then prioritizing the two or three most important aspects that you want that prospect to know\u2014that\u2019s your brand.<br \/>\nOnce you have that ironed out? It\u2019s important to ensure that you leverage it everywhere. \u201cApply it consistently across all channels, including your resume, social media profiles, portfolio, and elevator pitch,\u201d Domeyer adds.<br \/>\n<b>2. Polish your portfolio<\/b><br \/>\nWith your personal brand in place, it\u2019s time to turn your focus toward your portfolio. \u201cWhen looking for creative skillsets for our creative agency, the freelancer needs to have a hard-hitting, beautifully designed, and clearly articulated portfolio,\u201d shares Lindsay Brady, Group Director, Production at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigspaceship.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Big Spaceship LLC<\/a>, a digital agency.<br \/>\nWhat your own portfolio looks like will depend on what sort of capacity you work in (a portfolio will be different for a designer versus a writer, for example). However, your portfolio shouldn\u2019t be something you throw together at the last minute before a meeting with a prospective client, and it should clearly illustrate what you bring to the table.<br \/>\n\u201cIt needs to tell us in a few sentences what the freelancer has to offer and how their skillsets can take the work to the next level,\u201d Brady adds. Having a polished and professional portfolio in your arsenal will be a huge asset to you when you&#8217;re trying to get a freelance job.<br \/>\n<b>3. Use references<\/b><br \/>\nBehold the power of word-of-mouth marketing. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/us\/en\/insights\/news\/2013\/under-the-influence-consumer-trust-in-advertising.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">84 percent of consumers<\/a> state that they either completely or somewhat trust recommendations from friends, colleagues, and family about products and services\u2014making these personal recommendations the highest ranked source for trustworthiness.<\/p>\n<p>Think this doesn\u2019t apply to your prospective freelance clients and your ability to get a freelance job? Think again.<br \/>\n\u201cReferences are also a big win,\u201d says Brady, \u201cIf you can showcase who you have worked with or real testimonials from agencies you have worked with, there\u2019s often times when references can enhance the opportunity to be hired.\u201d<br \/>\nSo, when you wrap up a project for a happy client? Don\u2019t forget to ask for a quick testimonial that you could use on your website or even directly in project proposals. They can really help you land gigs.<br \/>\n\u201cOne key piece of feedback I get over and over is [that] my testimonials are one of the reasons people work with me,\u201d says Halley Gray, a marketing expert and career coach, in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/40419480\/5-pieces-of-job-interview-advice-that-can-help-you-land-freelance-clients\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">piece for Fast Company<\/a>.<br \/>\n<b>4. Communicate frequently<\/b><br \/>\nEffective communication is huge, particularly when the vast majority of freelancers work remotely. So, right from the get-go, you need to be able to demonstrate that you won\u2019t mysteriously fall off the radar and leave that client in a lurch with nothing but radio silence.<br \/>\n\u201cCommunicating and getting back to us as soon as they are available or interested,\u201d states Brady about another thing she looks for when vetting freelancers.<\/p>\n<p>She also mentions that she appreciates freelancers who keep the agency updated on their own availability. \u201cIt\u2019s great hearing from freelancers about when they would become available again,\u201d she explains, \u201cThis keeps them top of mind and gives us the tools we need to resource our project quickly.\u201d<br \/>\nPlus, this frequent communication and added effort to maintain a relationship could help lead you to what\u2019s often considered the holy grail of all freelance jobs: retainers.<\/p>\n<h3>The Don\u2019ts<\/h3>\n<p><b>1. Complain about past clients<\/b><br \/>\nThat past client that took forever to pay you. The client who kept adding more and more to the project\u2014without increasing the budget. Or, that pesky one who continuously gave totally baseless feedback and criticisms.<br \/>\nYou\u2019ve likely had your fair share of groan-worthy clients. But, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to divulge those dirty details to a prospective new one.<br \/>\n\u201cOne of the biggest red flags is complaining about a past job,\u201d shares Domeyer, \u201cBadmouthing former employers, colleagues, or clients may lead hiring managers to question your professionalism and attitude.\u201d<br \/>\nBut, what about when you\u2019re asked to talk about work-related challenges? You can be honest about any previous roadblocks and how you overcame them. But, Domeyer states that it\u2019s important that you do so with tact. \u201cThe ability to describe difficult situations diplomatically can turn the tables in your favor.\u201d<br \/>\nBasically, your mom\u2019s age-old advice was right: If you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, you\u2019re usually better saying nothing at all. Demonstrating that level of professionalism is a necessary first step in helping you get a freelance job.<br \/>\n<b>2. Neglect to update information<\/b><br \/>\nWhen a potential client looks online to find out more about you, what do you want them to see? That awesome project you just wrapped up last month? Or, the moldy skills, portfolio pieces, and information you haven\u2019t bothered to update in three years? Probably the first one, right?<br \/>\n\u201cPortfolio sites or other sites showcasing freelancer work should be up to date on what the freelancers are working on,\u201d shares Brady, \u201cMany times freelancers\u2019 comps are the best to portray what they are working on.\u201d<br \/>\nSet a monthly reminder for yourself to comb through your website, LinkedIn portfolio, and any other sites where you have your information and samples listed so that you can make sure to knock the cobwebs off every now and then. It\u2019ll only take a few minutes, but can make all the difference when trying to get a freelance job.<br \/>\n<b>3. Let skills get rusty<\/b><br \/>\nWhen you work in a creative field, you know just how fast things change. If you want to remain relevant and impressive? You need to stay on top of those changes.<br \/>\n\u201cSince technology changes so quickly, it\u2019s best to showcase that you as the freelancer can pivot at any moment and be able to keep up with the changing avenues,\u201d shares Brady.<br \/>\nWhile it can be tough to manage all of the different hats you need to wear as a freelancer\u2014from being your own accountant to your own office manager (hey, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a> can help!)\u2014make an effort to still leave time for some professional development. Whether it\u2019s reading an industry-relevant book or taking an online course to pick up a new needed skill, making the time to stay on top of things is sure to set you apart.<\/p>\n<h3>Over to you<\/h3>\n<p>Landing gigs as a freelancer isn\u2019t just important\u2014it\u2019s necessary (you want a paycheck, right?). But, with so much competition out there, figuring out how to stand out and score a new client isn\u2019t always easy.<br \/>\nFortunately, there are some things you can do to get noticed and ultimately get hired. Take this advice from the experts, and you\u2019re much more likely to add more projects and clients to your ever-growing roster.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How can you separate yourself from the competition and land more freelance jobs?
