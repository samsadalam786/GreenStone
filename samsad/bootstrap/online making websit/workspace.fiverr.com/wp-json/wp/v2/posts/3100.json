People immediately took to Twitter to question what happened. Were Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway tired or tipsy? Did Emma Stone hand off her envelope? Was Jimmy Kimmel being funny?<br \/>\nEventually, PwC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/02\/27\/entertainment\/oscars-mix-up-pricewaterhousecoopers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">took responsibility<\/a> for the mix-up, but not before a confused crowd of stars got caught up in the blame game. As a freelancer, when you make a big mistake things can go down quite differently. You\u2019re a lone wolf, and\u2014not to provoke too much unbridled anxiety\u2014but the responsibility of your work rests on your shoulders, and your shoulders alone.<br \/>\nDale Carnegie, legendary self-development coach and speaker touted a simple approach to approaching mistakes. His go-to adage? \u201cThe successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way.\u201d Whether you\u2019ve committed a mishap to the scale of the Oscar #envelopegate, or simply failed to deliver something to a client as promised, the next steps you take\u00a0are critical to maintaining your professional reputation as a freelancer.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Own it<\/h3>\n<p>The first step is the easiest, but for some people, it\u2019s the hardest: Transparently (and swiftly) fess up to the error. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thewrap.com\/oscar-stage-manager-pwc-accountants-incompetence\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">One particularly damning record<\/a> of what went down at the Oscars alleges that the lead PwC accountants completely &#8220;froze&#8221; upon making the error, and only acted to rectify it when prodded by the show&#8217;s production team. If this is indeed what happened (and who can know for sure what really\u00a0<em>did<\/em> happen?), then this is a case study on what NOT to do.<br \/>\nAs Claire Bentley, a Dallas-based human resources manager says, \u201cFinding out that an individual hid a mistake or didn\u2019t say anything about it is worse than the mistake itself to an employer.\u201d So, as soon as you\u2019ve realized your mistake\u2014or if you\u2019re anticipating certain failure, even\u2014just come clean.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Breathe!<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re not recommending\u00a0you take the day off and get a massage, but try to have some perspective with regard to your mistakes. Generally speaking, says Bentley, individuals are more critical of their own mistakes than their employers may be\u2014and serving as your own worst enemy may be especially true for freelancers who are in charge of their own livelihood and therefore typically extra conscientious of their performance. Realize that unless someone was hurt, mistakes may not be as bad as you think. Step back and taking a deep breath so you\u2019re in a better place to take on the next most important step.<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Communicate a thoughtful solution<\/h3>\n<p>You may not be able to undo a\u00a0mistake, but once you\u2019ve taken ownership, you can keep in touch with the client to guide them through your diligent path to remedy the error as best you can. Erin Desrosiers, division director of Creative Salaried Professionals for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roberthalf.com\/los-angeles\/creative-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Creative Group<\/a>, has had to broker relationships between freelancers and clients\u2014and their successes and failures reflect back on her team when they make the match. A lack of communication is one of the most common mistakes she encounters. Recently, when a freelancer blatantly blew off an assignment, the fact that the individual waited until the work was due to tell the client it wasn\u2019t getting done was as infuriating as the excuse itself.<br \/>\nSwiftly owning up to a\u00a0mistake instead of wasting time and energy worrying and trying to cover things up allows you to come up with a solution, says Bentley. Ideally, your solution should follow in lock-step with your transparent communication of the issue at-hand. In other words, \u201cHere\u2019s what happened, here&#8217;s why it happened, and here&#8217;s what I am going to do to make it better.&#8221;<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-fix-freelance-mistakes%2F&#038;text=S%2A%2AT%21%20You%20messed%20up%20as%20a%20%23freelancer.%20Here%20are%20the%20steps%20you%20need%20to%20take%20right%20now.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S**T!

How we recover from these mistakes ultimately forms a significant piece of our reputation and character in the eyes of our clients. Of course, the ideal is to never make the mistake in the first place. But you\u2019re a human being. These things will happen. (That said, proper planning and communication from Day 1 will ensure the screw-up isn\u2019t as monumental as #envelopegate.)<br \/>\nOur number one piece of advice: be transparent with the mistake but focus on the positive\u2014that is, the solution\u2014instead of dwelling on something you cannot change. Look forward to fix the issue, and always reflect back in order to to learn and grow from the experience.<br \/>\n<em><strong>How have you recovered from past mistakes?
