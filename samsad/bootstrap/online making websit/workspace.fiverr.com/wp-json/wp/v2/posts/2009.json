They ranged from bartender to dog walker to Producing assistant to chocolatier to fitness instructor\u2026 you name it, I\u2019ve done it. I did all of these jobs in order to pursue my passion and career in the arts as an actress. Over the past year, I\u2019ve shifted my focus of being an actress and have started my own business, called <a href=\"https:\/\/theartistco-op.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Artist Co-op<\/a>, a coworking space for the performing arts community. The idea came out of frustration, as an actress. I was constantly auditioning for shows, running to acting classes, or meeting with potential collaborators. None of these activities ever made me feel quite validated as an artist. But, what I did find most fulfilling, was creating and developing my own work as an artist.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>For example, last year I worked with three other women on devising a performance piece about the future of technology. We brought the piece to the Edinburgh fringe, which is the biggest festival for new and emerging art in the world. This experience was so invigorating. I met people from all over the world. We saw new shows together. Afterwards, we\u2019d meet at the pub and discuss what we liked and didn\u2019t like about the performances. I realized there wasn\u2019t a space like this in New York City. As artists, we need a space to congregate, work, develop, share our skills and crafts, what better environment than something a coworking space like WeWork.<br \/>\nWhile I\u2019ve been developing the Artist Co-op I\u2019ve realized how the actor\/artist is the original entrepreneur, we are \u201cartrepreneurs.\u201d We \u2018sell\u2019 our talents (mind and body) to help a vision come to life on stage. There are some creative take-a-ways the artist community can teach the freelancer gig economy:<\/p>\n<h2>Think Outside the Box<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Sometimes we pick up gigs in order to pay rent, utilities, and healthcare but you shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice your happiness to do a job that you hate. I bet you\u2019re crafty. Maybe you\u2019ve got a secret passion for woodcarving or knitting, so why not sell your products on Etsy. Also, there are great quick jobs to pick up on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taskrabbit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Task Rabbit<\/a> that can help keep the funds coming in even when the roles aren&#8217;t \u2026<\/li>\n<li>When you\u2019re not performing there are plenty of jobs that creatives do that don\u2019t rely on waiting tables:\u00a0 Tour Guides, Fitness instructors, UX design, Project managers, Production Assistants, Interior designers, Life Coach, etc&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>You are a Business<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it, the arts is a business\u2026 why do you think they call it &#8216;Show Business&#8217;?\u00a0We can\u2019t let chance dictate our lives. I have had to change my mindset and not relying on chance when it comes to work especially in the arts. More on creating your own work in the DIY section, but we have to remember this is a business.<\/li>\n<li>Save your receipts: As an actor, you can write off different expenses that apply to your business. From teeth whitening to haircuts, you should always save your receipts. These expenses go towards building your artist business.<\/li>\n<li>Pinching Pennies: My bubby (grandmother in Yiddish) grew up during the Great Depression. She was always clipping coupons. You never know where you\u2019ll find a good deal, whether it\u2019s online, in the newspaper or walking by a shop. Have an open mind.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>DIY &#8212; Creating Your Own Work<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>I\u2019ve become a big fan of creating your own work. There are many \u201cgate-keepers\u201d in this industry who tell us we can\u2019t do something or aren\u2019t good enough, whether it\u2019s a manager, agent, casting director etc. I like to think, \u201cif there\u2019s a will\u2026 there\u2019s a way.\u201d Why not start writing that web series you\u2019ve been dreaming about starring in. Or maybe it\u2019s about getting an improv troupe together or choreographing a flash mob. Thankfully with the internet, we can share our work with a bigger audience. This is a crazy example, but you know Justin Bieber was discovered on Youtube! Another more relevant example is the show <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hbo.com\/high-maintenance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>High Maintenance<\/em><\/a> started as a mini-webseries on Vimeo and then got picked up by HBO.<\/li>\n<li>Don\u2019t forget to take big risks: You\u2019ll never know unless you try. You might not consider yourself a writer but more of an actor, so why not try dabbling in screenwriting. I bet your idea is great! With the help from your accountability partner and community over at The Artist Co-op, there will be plenty of people to lend advice and see your project come to fruition.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>The Power of \u201cNo\u201d<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If it doesn\u2019t benefit you, don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cno.\u201d Gigs are opportunities, a stepping stone to something bigger, but don\u2019t let them take time away from what you really came here to do. Sometimes I found myself in the routine of a day job I hated but I liked the consistent money coming in. Yet I was so unhappy that I stopped producing art. Make sure to check in with yourself. I moved to New York City for a reason. I thought at by 28 I would be a famous Broadway actress, but life has a weird way of opening other doors. Instead I have discovered how much joy I get by creating The Artist Co-op. I love bringing together different kinds of communities and sharing the values of communal spirit.<\/li>\n<li>Remember to take care of yourself. Especially in this gig economy when I\u2019m trying to take every potential job, sometimes I lose sight of myself. There are small things I like to do to take stalk of what I\u2019ve got. I try and journal. I use this great website called <a href=\"https:\/\/750words.com\/\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?hl=en&amp;q=https:\/\/750words.com&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1481139618693000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH2zrof-WEvjJGpFcp82M1UZYkKuw\">750words.com<\/a>. Other things that help when the going gets tough is meditation and exercise.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Accountability Partners<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Find someone that will hold you accountable and can check in on you. This person will make sure you finished your first draft of that play you\u2019ve been meaning to write or go out an audition for that big role you\u2019ve been dreaming about.\u00a0I\u2019ve got a friend who makes sure I\u2019ve followed up with important meetings.<\/li>\n<li>It\u2019s so important to surround yourself with cheerleaders. People who believe in what you\u2019re making. They are your support system. We are in a collaborative art form. Even if you\u2019re writing a one person show, you\u2019ll need a director, lighting designer, stage manager, costumer and more. We build a temporary moment to share something together. As Lin Manuel Miranda wrote in his critically acclaimed Broadway musical Hamilton, \u201cI want to be in the room where it happens.\u201d There\u2019s nothing in the world that technology can do that can compare to the power of LIVE ARTS.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019ve had a lot of jobs, more than I can count on my 10 fingers.
