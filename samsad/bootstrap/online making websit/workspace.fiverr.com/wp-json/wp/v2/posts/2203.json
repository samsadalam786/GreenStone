There are a number of items you will want to customize initially:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>your business name<\/li>\n<li>a logo<\/li>\n<li>payment methods<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve added these once, they can be used as a template for your invoices going forwards.<\/p>\n<h4>Putting your logo or headshot on your invoice<\/h4>\n<p>Repetition has been <a href=\"https:\/\/warrington.ufl.edu\/departments\/mkt\/docs\/janiszewski\/BrandLogo.pdf\">shown to increase liking<\/a> for a brand. And if nothing else, presenting a consistent image of your company across all of your correspondence\u00a0can\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-make-your-business-look-bigger-than-it-is\/\">make your business appear more professional<\/a>.<br \/>\nIf you don&#8217;t have the type of graphic design skills needed to create your own logo, this might be a good time to hire someone on a service like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr<\/a> for the project. Even if your brand is just simply your own name, you can make a logo that&#8217;ll help you stand out from the rest of the invoices on your client&#8217;s desk.<br \/>\nIf you&#8217;re really not ready for creating your own logo, another option is to include your headshot on your invoice. Seeing your friendly face will humanize your brand and help build trust with your client.<\/p>\n<h4>Offer multiple payment options<\/h4>\n<p>You want your money, right?<br \/>\nOffering several options for your clients to get paid is a great way to ensure you get paid faster.<br \/>\nIf you use a service like AND CO, you can create a personal <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/payments\">pay me page<\/a> on your invoice, where you can accept online payments through services like <a href=\"https:\/\/stripe.com\/\">Stripe<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/\">Paypal<\/a>. Plus, Fiverr Workspace will automatically remind you if a client is <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/what-freelancers-can-do-when-a-client-payment-is-late\/\">late with a payment.<\/a><br \/>\nYou should also customize your payment terms, indicating whether your client has agreed to pay you upon receipt, or within a certain number of days.<br \/>\n<strong><em>More:<\/em><\/strong>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-freelancers-guide-to-getting-your-invoices-paid-faster\/\">The Freelancer\u2019s Guide to Getting Your Invoices Paid Faster<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>How to customize each invoice<\/h3>\n<p>As well as the items that can be templated, there are also some items that may need to be customized for each invoice, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>payment terms<\/li>\n<li>the due date<\/li>\n<li>personal notes<\/li>\n<li>line items<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><\/h4>\n<h4>Personal notes: a chance for gratitude<\/h4>\n<p>An invoice is not a Hallmark card, but if there is any place on the invoice to express your thanks it is in the personal notes. It&#8217;s important that you don&#8217;t go overboard here, though. A simple \u201cThank you for your business\u201d or something similar should suffice.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to really delight your client, add their name here. It&#8217;s been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1647299\/\">scientifically proven<\/a> that\u00a0hearing your own name lights up an entirely different part of your brain than any other word or phrase. Mentioning your client&#8217;s name is one of the simplest ways to grab their attention and remind them of your existing relationship.<\/p>\n<p>And if you want to get even more personal, you could make special mention of your working relationship with your client. A comment like, &#8220;Joan, thanks for ordering for the fifth time!&#8221; or &#8220;Mark, thanks for letting us be your copywriters for the past year. Here&#8217;s to another great year together!&#8221;, will help reinforce your gratitude for their custom.<br \/>\nOther ideas are to offer something valuable for your client here, like a discount on future work, or a referral bonus they can gain by telling someone else about your services.<\/p>\n<h4>Legal reminders<\/h4>\n<p>In the note area of the invoice, you may also want to give your client a quick reminder of legal matters\u2014an example might be if copyright is changing hands once the invoice is paid, in which case you could state something like, \u201cCopyright remains with the developer until the date payment is received.\u201d No need to be too threatening, but just having the information on there might lead to a quick payment, especially if your client is working to launch something and needs to know that they own the intellectual property you helped to create ASAP.<br \/>\nIf <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\">your contract<\/a>\u00a0had a clause about fees or interest for late payments, you can also include a friendly reminder about this here.<\/p>\n<h4>Line items<\/h4>\n<p>Line items are one place where there is not a lot of customization needed. Clarity here is key. The line item should include the dates, what service was delivered, the quantity, and the costs. Most importantly, you should be sure that everything is accurate\u2014this is the part of the invoice that your client will scrutinize most closely, and for good reason, because it&#8217;s where they will find the most information about what they are paying you for.<br \/>\nKeep your descriptions uniform. If you&#8217;re a writer, for example, every line item for a separate article should have the same information listed in the same order\u2014that way both you and your client can quickly and easily see what&#8217;s been done. This will also allow you to check your invoices against the information entered into your accounting software and may help you when reconciling your books.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Related:\u00a0<\/em><\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/7-things-to-do-before-you-send-your-next-invoice\/\">7 Things to Do Before You Send Your Next Invoice<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Customize your next invoice<\/h3>\n<p>While an invoice not meant to be a work of art, a well thought out invoice can lead to faster payments, smoother workflow in the reconciling of your books, repeated work with your client, and a boost to your brand&#8217;s image.
