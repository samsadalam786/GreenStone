More than 1 billion people worldwide lean on Google\u2019s email client for business and personal purposes. If you\u2019re in this sizable (and growing) population, browse the hacks below to make the most of the product for your freelance business.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #1: \u2018I have attached\u2026\u2019<\/h3>\n<p>Had the \u201cOops!\u201d moment yet? You send an email to your client that is intended to contain the completed documents. After the Send button\u2019s been hit you realize you forgot to attach the files and an embarrassing \u201cSorry, forgot to attach the files\u201d email follows.<br \/>\nWorse case scenario: you don\u2019t realize you haven\u2019t attached the files and the client gets back to you with a \u201cWhere are the files? There was nothing attached\u201d email. Ouch!<br \/>\nAll you have to do to ensure you never forgot to attach the files is type in \u201cI have attached\u201d in your email\u2019s body.<br \/>\nSo, for instance, if I am submitting next month\u2019s quota of five blog posts to a client, I\u2019d write \u201cHi Sandra, I have attached the five blog posts for December\u2026.\u201d. Now, if I forget to attach those blog posts and click Send, Gmail will give a warning that says: \u201cDid you mean to attach files? You wrote \u201cI have attached\u201d in your message, but there are no files attached. Send anyway?\u201d. Magic.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #2: Innumerable Email IDs<\/h3>\n<p>Most freelancers sign up for and subscribe to several newsletters, websites, and online events. Giving your email address liberally is a necessity if you want great information and possible leads to reach you from the various corners of the internet every single day. However, this opens up several inroads for spam.<br \/>\nThe solution? A unique email address for each subscription! One email address on Gmail equals to an infinite number of email addresses. How?<br \/>\nThe \u201c+\u201d character can be used to generate infinite number of email addresses. For example, if my email address is xyz@gmail.com, then emails to xyz+new@gmail.com, xyz+abscdiienfldsl@gmail.com, xyz+business@gmail.com, etc. will all land in my inbox. You can add anything after the + sign and still receive emails in your inbox.<br \/>\nI use this feature whenever I subscribe to a freelance writing newsletter, or sign up for an event or just about any mailing list.<br \/>\nSo, if I sign up for Marketo\u2019s mailing list, I\u2019ll enter my email address as kaziurooj+marketo@gmail.com. Now, if I start receiving spam in my gmail inbox and the \u201cfrom\u201d address is kaziurooj+marketo@gmail.com, I\u2019ll know that the Marketo mailing list has been compromised, and immediately unsubscribe.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #3: Organize The Heck Out of Your Inbox<\/h3>\n<p>Labels are the best way to keep a freelancer\u2019s inbox organized. They are essentially markers that you can use to filter and segregate your emails in different folders.<br \/>\nSo, if you want to keep all updates from LinkedIn in one folder, because you don\u2019t want these updates overwhelming your inbox or wish to keep updates from a website you\u2019ve subscribed to in another folder, labels are the way to go.<br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t already use labels in Gmail, this <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/mail\/answer\/118708?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">support page<\/a> can help you.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #4: Vacation Responder<\/h3>\n<p>Always keep your clients, and prospective clients, informed if you\u2019d be unavailable for more than two days.<br \/>\nThe vacation responder feature can be accessed by clicking on the gear-shaped button on the top right of your gmail mailbox &gt; Settings &gt; Scroll down &gt; Vacation responder &gt; Turn vacation responder on. In the text box below add in text that informs those who contact you how long you\u2019ll be away and how they can contact you if there\u2019s an emergency.<br \/>\nI find the vacation responder very helpful. For instance, I will be taking my annual 10-day vacation in December. If someone visits my website and decides to hire me to write content for their business, shoots me an email while I am away on my vacation, they\u2019ll know when to expect a response if I\u2019ve set up an auto-responder.<br \/>\nHowever, if there\u2019s no responder set up, it looks really unprofessional (and I might lose that client) if I get in touch with them 10 days after their email.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #5: Desktop Notifications<\/h3>\n<p>Most freelancers complain of a compulsion to check their emails every five minutes. This compulsion affects your productivity.<br \/>\nThere was a time, not very long ago, when the first thing I used to do every morning was check my email. My smartphone was right by my side all night. Not any longer.<br \/>\nSo, if you share my compulsion for email checking, this feature will be really useful.<br \/>\nHere\u2019s how you set it up: Gear-shaped button &gt; settings &gt; scroll down &gt; Desktop notifications &gt; New mail notifications on. Now every email you receive in your inbox will show up as a notification, irrespective of what you are doing at that point in time.<br \/>\nIf you know that you\u2019ll receive a notification whenever an email\u2019s received it will drastically reduce your compulsion to check your email and will help you concentrate better on the task at hand.<\/p>\n<h3>Trick #6: Boomerang for Gmail<\/h3>\n<p>How cool would it be if you had your own personal assistant to remind you of emails you forgot to respond to, of client emails you have to follow up on, or to simply schedule your cold pitch emails for times when they have a higher probability of getting read?<br \/>\nBoomerang is a third-party add-on for your Gmail that does all this and more. They have a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boomeranggmail.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30-day free trial<\/a>, so that\u2019s a great way to get started and see how useful it might be for you.<br \/>\n<em><strong>So, there you have it.
