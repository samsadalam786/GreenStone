Ideally, more than a link to your Facebook page and an archived news article about your high school soccer tournament.<br \/>\nFortunately, you can control what you put out there with a super buttoned-up online portfolio (read: bragging rights). Even if you\u2019re not actively looking for a job\u2014most freelancers are always on the hunt for new clients, though #respectthehustle\u2014 it\u2019s important to keep your work or side projects updated and in tip-top shape.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fanatomy-compelling-online-portfolio%2F&#038;text=Think%20of%20your%20online%20portfolio%20as%20an%20extension%20of%20yourself.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Think of your online portfolio as an extension of yourself. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fanatomy-compelling-online-portfolio%2F&#038;text=Think%20of%20your%20online%20portfolio%20as%20an%20extension%20of%20yourself.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nThink of your online portfolio as an extension of yourself, giving those viewing it more context into your passions, career, or both. For a stand-out one, here\u2019s what it should include:<\/p>\n<h3>1. Your story<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, visitors to your online portfolio want to know more about the work you do. But, they also want to understand more about you as a person.<br \/>\nFor that reason, make sure you include a brief bio or a bit about your background on your homepage or on a designated <a href=\"https:\/\/99u.com\/articles\/51669\/how-to-write-about-me-section\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201cAbout Me\u201d page<\/a>.<br \/>\nWhether you discovered an early passion for photography while using a disposable camera to photograph your stuffed animals or found web design to be an amazing creative outlet while stuck in your soul-sucking nine-to-five, take time to share what got you to where you are today.<br \/>\nAnother thing to include? A tagline in a prominent place on the homepage of your site. I know, it can feel a little promotional. But, it\u2019s an effective way for people to immediately glean what you do and who you do it for\u2014without needing to do endless scrolling.<br \/>\n<strong>Here\u2019s an example:<\/strong><br \/>\n<em>Freelance content marketer helping brands to educate and engage their audiences.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>2. Who&nbsp;you&#8217;ve worked with<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, your online portfolio is a place where you can brag about all of the jaw-droppingly awesome work you\u2019ve done\u2014as well as the unbelievable clients you\u2019ve done it for.<br \/>\nInclude the names (or logos, if you can!) of some of the most impressive outlets that you\u2019ve worked with in the past. Just make sure to get the necessary permission before promoting them on your site.<br \/>\nDoing so will add a hefty dose of credibility to your reputation as a freelancer.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Samples of&nbsp;your work<\/h3>\n<p>Here it is, the meat and potatoes of your site. Your online portfolio should be just that\u2014a portfolio, meaning it should adequately showcase samples of your previous work.<br \/>\nThere are a few important things to keep in mind here. For starters, don\u2019t think that you need to include every single project on your site (believe me, people won\u2019t take the time to click through all 800 of them!). It\u2019s far better to be selective, put together a good variety, and highlight only the work that you\u2019re most proud of.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fanatomy-compelling-online-portfolio%2F&#038;text=For%20your%20online%20portfolio%2C%20choose%20the%20work%20you%27re%20most%20proud%20of.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">For your online portfolio, choose the work you&#039;re most proud of. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fanatomy-compelling-online-portfolio%2F&#038;text=For%20your%20online%20portfolio%2C%20choose%20the%20work%20you%27re%20most%20proud%20of.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nSecondly, find a way to present your samples in a way that\u2019s easy to navigate and digest. Slow loading times caused by massive files will only frustrate your visitors\u2014meaning they\u2019ll likely leave before ever even seeing the work that makes you so hirable.<\/p>\n<h3>4. List of capabilities<\/h3>\n<p>Your work samples are a great way to show what you do. But, sometimes it\u2019s also necessary to explicitly state it. This solidifies your brand as a freelancer, and also makes it immediately clear what sort of projects you will and won\u2019t take on.<br \/>\nFor example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a freelance writer. Will you work on anything involving the written word\u2014from website copy to press releases? Or, do you prefer to stick to more editorial content, such as articles and ebooks?<br \/>\nGet specific about what you do, and your portfolio will put in the legwork of weeding through prospective clients for you.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Blog<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cHey, but I\u2019m not a writer!\u201d I can hear you protesting all the way over here. And, I get it\u2014if you aren\u2019t trying to cut it as a freelance writer, why would you even think of including a blog as part of your portfolio?<br \/>\nTrue, you may not be a wordsmith by trade. But, make no mistake, you\u2019re still trying to establish yourself as an expert in your chosen field, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/advice\/6-things-you-should-put-on-your-personal-websiteand-6-things-to-avoid-at-all-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">authoring related blog posts<\/a> is a great way to do just that.<br \/>\nPerhaps you\u2019re a web developer who will author helpful posts about best practices. Or, maybe you\u2019re a graphic designer who will share simple tips and advice.<br \/>\nWriting this sort of content (even if you\u2019re not a born writer!) will establish you as a thought leader, which is bound to be appealing to any prospective clients in search of a freelancer who really knows what he or she is doing (spoiler alert: all clients are looking for this exact thing!).<\/p>\n<h3>6. Testimonials<\/h3>\n<p>You already know that word-of-mouth marketing is incredibly powerful. So, why not leverage that for yourself?<br \/>\nAsk some past happy clients if they\u2019d be willing to <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/the-power-of-personal\/2016\/04\/11\/6-best-personal-websites\/#.tnw_upgHVHqS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">provide a testimonial for you<\/a> to include with your portfolio.<br \/>\nWhether you want to use short and snappy quotes or even video messages, sharing these sorts of recommendations will show potential new clients that you don\u2019t just talk the talk\u2014you also walk the walk.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Social&nbsp;media links<\/h3>\n<p>If you include all of the above elements, you\u2019ll have a comprehensive online hub where everybody from employers to your Google-happy mother (hi, mom!) can learn more about what you\u2019re capable of.<br \/>\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t provide additional resources where visitors can dive in and find out even more. Are you active on Twitter? Do you post frequent updates on LinkedIn? Do you share great snapshots on Instagram?<br \/>\nInclude links to any relevant (and, of course, professional!) social media accounts so that people can take things one step further and get to know you on a more personal level\u2014outside of the confines of your beautifully-crafted website.<br \/>\nThere you go\u2014all of the boxes you should check when creating your online portfolio. The final thing you should be sure to include? Your contact information.<br \/>\nWhether you want to use a fillable form, list your email address, or provide your coordinates for carrier pigeons (we don\u2019t recommend that, by the way), you need to give people a way to get in touch. That way, when they\u2019re undoubtedly impressed with your work, they can easily reach out\u2014and, of course, hire you.<br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em><strong>What do you add to your online portfolio to make it pop?
