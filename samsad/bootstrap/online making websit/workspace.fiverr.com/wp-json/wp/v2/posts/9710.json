You\u2019d sign into your instant messaging program\u2014 let\u2019s be honest, it was AIM or bust\u2014 and coordinate your mall meetup. As a great meme pointed out, there was a time when we had to say \u201cbrb\u201d or \u201cg2g\u201d because once we left our desktop we were actually gone. This was a time when texting plans didn\u2019t exist, and we were too young to appreciate the solitude.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But just because we\u2019re older doesn\u2019t mean instant messaging has gone away. In fact, it\u2019s just as integral to our lives now as it was all those years ago. In a way, it\u2019s more important now. Today, we need to talk about everything from collaborations to payment schedules. This is especially true for freelancers. If you\u2019re working out of an office, you may be a part of any intraoffice communications in place. But if you\u2019re working solo, it may be on you to find the best ways to stay in touch with clients, editors, and colleagues. Lucky for you, many companies have kept up with the times and created amazing instant messaging applications. There are loads to choose from, so why not pick one of these to get started?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fring.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fring<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Fring.png\" alt=\"Fring Messenger Apps Freelancers Need to Check Out apps, app, tech, messaging, freelance, freelance messenger\" class=\"wp-image-629\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s app that looks to make phone calls just as important as live messaging. According to research, there are 12 billion internet connected devices on earth. That comes out to about 1.7 devices per person! Fring\u2019s philosophy rests on the idea that better communication shouldn\u2019t require another smart device. Why not use what you already have? With the app, you\u2019re connected to Fring\u2019s network and can make voice and video calls, as well as send texts. Then there&#8217;s FringOut, which allows users to make outbound calls to those who don\u2019t have the app. This is especially useful for the freelancer who get matched with a client outside of the country. Why rack up your mobile bill when you can FringOut at affordable rates as low as $0.01\/minute?<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company is also planning to launch FringIn, which allows users to receive landline calls. It\u2019s like a shadow mobile network. If you\u2019re part of a far-flung network of freelancers\u2014 or if your business employees all over the world\u2014 Fring may be worth looking into.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skype.com\/en\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skype<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/skype-logo.jpg\" alt=\"skype-logo Messenger Apps Freelancers Need to Check Out apps, app, tech, messaging, freelance, freelance messenger\" class=\"wp-image-628\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skype is the app we downloaded when we went off to college and swore to keep in touch with our high school friends. When Facebook was still figuring out their own nascent messaging applications, Skype was there to connect you to your old chums in glorious, pixelated video. But just as you got yourself together and figured out what you were capable of, Skype grew up and realized it had a ton of potential\u2026 and then tapped into it. In part because of the familiarity factor (and also because it excels at what it does) Skype has remained the gold standard for video messaging. If you\u2019re using it for video chat, it\u2019s devastatingly simple. But there&#8217;re loads of other useful features, too! <\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a video call isn\u2019t necessary, you can still communicate with clients via a built-in instant messaging function. It &nbsp;allows for dozens of users on the same chat channel, which is useful if you\u2019re part of a larger collaborative effort. And because we\u2019re not always in our best headspace at any given time, you can disable Skype\u2019s video chat feature and use it as voice chat. By using a paid credit system, it also allows you to make international calls as well. Coolest of all is their screen share function. If you find yourself dealing with a client who just doesn\u2019t seem to get it, you can guide them through your process as if you were sitting right next to them.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https:\/\/app.and.co\/signup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screenshot_1-1.jpg\" alt=\"automate your freelance business Fiverr Workspace\" class=\"wp-image-166\"\/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/get.slack.help\/hc\/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slack<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Slack.png\" alt=\"Slack Messenger Apps Freelancers Need to Check Out apps, app, tech, messaging, freelance, freelance messenger\" class=\"wp-image-627\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If talking about Skype tells us you\u2019ve touched a computer within the past ten years, talking about Slack tells us you\u2019ve touched one within the past two. It\u2019s hard to have a relevant discussion about messaging apps without mentioning this one. But Slack isn\u2019t just skating by on a colorful interface and a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/01\/slack-raises-200m-at-3-8b-valuation-for-business-messaging\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$3.8 billion valuation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s taken on quite a bit during its short time on our devices. Slack is trying to integrate every aspect of the creative, organizational, and communicative process. You can share files with your team in a pinch. If you\u2019re working on a group project, you can edit your documents in real time. What takes it to the next level, though, are its use of slash commands. Alone, they trigger actions within the app. Typing \u201c\/remind list\u201d, for example, gives you a list of all your current reminders. \u201c\/mute\u201d will disable notifications if it gets too distracting. But slack is working on integrating other apps into its platform and making them accessible through similar commands. So, while Slack doesn\u2019t have its own video messaging app, \u201c\/hangout\u201d will start a Google Chat Hangout.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/www.thingthing.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ThingThing<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ThingThing.png\" alt=\"ThingThing Messenger Apps Freelancers Need to Check Out apps, app, tech, messaging, freelance, freelance messenger\" class=\"wp-image-701\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It seems that a lot of communication apps focus on the desktop first and mobile later. Not Thingthing. It\u2019s a supercharged keyboard for iOS that helps you \u201ctype better.&#8221; It\u2019s kind of like a PDA made right for today\u2019s connected world.
