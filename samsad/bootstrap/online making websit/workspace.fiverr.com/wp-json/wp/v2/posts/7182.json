Basically, you&#8217;re your own boss.<br><br>But there\u2019s one catch: The minute you stop freelancing, you stop making money.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, it\u2019s a good idea to diversify your income, <em>especially <\/em>because freelancing offers <em>a ton <\/em>of flexibility and experience that can be further leveraged to start a business. <br><br>In fact, freelancing has allowed me to scale from writer to consultant and business owner (which brings in over 5 figures) in just a year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dherealmark.com\/life-after-graduation\/\">after my graduation.&nbsp;<\/a><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what business should you start?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, there are many ways to start your journey to being self employed but it\u2019s a good idea to reverse engineer people that have already done it (for inspiration).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\u2019ve reached out to freelancers that have scaled to business owners to understand what worked (and what didn\u2019t work) for them.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Create information products<\/li><li>Make money from client recommendations<\/li><li>Provide an expert consultancy service<\/li><li>Start a digital marketing agency<\/li><li>Coach people that want to be like you<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>(Spoiler alert: All these people started out as freelancers).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Create information products<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, you will possess valuable expertise and knowledge\u2014and this know-how can be leveraged to create information products.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>An information product is any form of digital products that shares knowledge with the purpose of educating the user in that area.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While having technical knowledge might be something you don\u2019t even think about anymore, selling it in the form of info products requires basic groundwork. But it\u2019s worth the effort you put in.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some perks to selling info products online:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Easy and cheap to sell: <\/strong>the investment surrounding info products is very low. Most of what you\u2019ll be spending is your mental energy to form ideas that you can sell over a digital medium, hence, reducing your financial risks.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>Free storage costs: <\/strong>your info products basically have free storage, unlike physical goods that require warehouses. You can store large amounts of data on the cloud and have multiple platforms to choose from.&nbsp;<\/li><li><strong>A huge market: <\/strong>you have a global audience at your fingertips and it&#8217;s easier to find a niche you can target online with information available at your disposal.<\/li><li><strong>High margins: <\/strong>selling info products limits most, if not all, of your costs to the digital world, making for a tempting ROI.&nbsp;<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Case: Adam Enfroy\u2019s Attractive Info Products<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/adamenfroy.com\">Ad<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/adamenfroy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"am Enfroy (opens in a new tab)\">am Enfroy<\/a>, a digital marketer grew his blog to over 150k monthly readers and leverage his expertise as a blogger to create info-products (think: link building and affiliate blueprint).&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These infographics work great for Adam\u2019s audience and more importantly, they\u2019re an easy way to bring in some passive income. <br><br>To give you an idea, if 100 people bought Adam\u2019s info-products, that would amount to a cool 3,900 bucks (And he has 150k visitors).&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly you can leverage, your know-how to easily create info-products and benefit from giving your audience <em>real<\/em> value.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Adamenfroy.com (opens in a new tab)\">Adamenfroy.com<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The files are uploaded and hosted on <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"BigCommerce (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BigCommerce<\/a>, and sync to his <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"WordPress (opens in a new tab)\">WordPress<\/a> site via an API.

Here\u2019s Hailey\u2019s advice: <strong>partner with marketing agencies in your niche.&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find someone who you can trust your clients with and negotiate a percentage that you both find fair for all business that you send them. This can be from 10% to even 50%. For your best shot, try and negotiate a residual commission deal with the agency.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Hailey\u2019s experience, agencies never want to turn down additional business and it\u2019s a win-win for both parties.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By utilizing your existing network and helping your clients in the process, they don\u2019t have to go seeking out and interviewing multiple service providers. You can also count on those clients sending lots of referrals for being helpful and a great connector!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the steps to follow to get started:<\/strong>&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Connect with CEOs\/founders\/owners of the partnerships you want<strong>: <\/strong>make the time to introduce yourself and your value proposition&nbsp;<\/li><li>Negotiate a fair commission rate<\/li><li>Start utilizing your existing client roster.

A skill that you can sell to people for good money? Are you an expert in a field that can provide insights and guidance to prospects?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a consultant is a good way to go. With the Internet on your side, running an online consultancy business has never been easier.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to draw an income without large capital investments like an office, consultancy is for you. Margins are high as less money is tied up in physical assets.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The greatest asset you have to sell here is <strong>your mind<\/strong>.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first you need to have a suitable client base, which might be challenging..<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to prove your expertise and form a trustworthy relationship with your customers.Then slowly scale up from there.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself these questions before considering an online consultancy business:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Do I have marketable skills and expertise that I can transform into a service?<\/li><li>Will this add value to my clients? Am I capable of providing solutions?<\/li><li>Do I have a feasible strategy to attract clients? Is there a market niche I can exploit?<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you answered yes, then you\u2019re on the right track to building your path as a self-employed consultant.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Case: Jeremy Noronha, Technical SEO Consultant<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of areas you can start up a consultancy in but the best way to go about it is to derive expertise from your own experience. <a href=\"https:\/\/jeremynoronha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Jeremy Noronha (opens in a new tab)\">Jeremy Noronha<\/a> is an example of this.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/p-Zlv1dCoi-fl6T036DRUr6DmJwHhlWeaT1QmkQr9Dy-TqOKmvqi4kTg4AMbNYIgN7hYU2IIw_HDewJo4MyGmgi_7lpn64enIb3p1vUtUtGODqbwsba_4BjxBMHVy0DaqUgASHd_\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https:\/\/jeremynoronha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Jeremy Noronha\u2019s blog (opens in a new tab)\">Jeremy Noronha\u2019s blog<\/a><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started off with no qualifications and no experience but this didn\u2019t stop him from making a living out of it.

Giving them the ability to charge more than an SEO freelancer who would stick to writing content.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consulting offers an amazing opportunity for those who have cross-functional skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>Start a Digital Marketing Agency<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have already decided to freelance, you must consider opening a digital marketing agency. For example, a self-employed content writer could easily scale up to their own digital marketing agency from scratch.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not need special set of skills or a PhD. All you need is hardwork and dedication.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leap from being a freelancer to running your own agency may seem daunting but it\u2019s an easy one if you\u2019re prepared.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel overwhelmed by the number of projects you have in the pipeline or wish to increase your capacity, an agency is a good way to scale up while still retaining some control.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By combining your expertise with others, you can create a business composed of high talent and multiple offerings rather than stay limited to a single service.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, over time, you can expand your digital marketing agency to include SEO, advertising and more.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Case: Brittany Ryan, Content Chief at Pointed Copywriting<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Brittany Ryan (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brittany-ryan-writes?originalSubdomain=cy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Brittany Ryan<\/a> is the founder of <a aria-label=\"Pointed Copywriting (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/pointedcopywriting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pointed Copywriting<\/a>, a SaaS content agency.\u00a0<br>Source: <a aria-label=\"LinkedIn (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/brittany-ryan-writes\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn<\/a><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her experience to building her own digital market agency stems from the experience of identifying unique differentiators in the transition from a solopreneur to <em>an agency.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It helps to identify your personal USP (user value proposition) first.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, your skill set, your perseverance and hustle can set you apart from your competition.
