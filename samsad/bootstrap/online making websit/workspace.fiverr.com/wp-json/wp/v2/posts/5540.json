The same issues cropped up again and again, so as freelancers, being conscious of these could help ensure you build stronger relationships with your clients. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hear it straight from the client\u2019s point of view, and consider how you could be a better freelancer. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>1. Lack of communication<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overwhelmingly, the most common concern that clients had with freelancers was their communication (or lack thereof).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ben Taylor, founder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.homeworkingclub.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Working Club<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says \u201cI often have freelancers apply for jobs with a good pitch, only to then drop the ball and fail to reply to subsequent messages.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, Monica Eaton-Cardone, co-founder and COO of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/chargebacks911.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chargebacks911<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, found that the biggest problem she\u2019s consistently had with freelancers is their tendency to go \u2018incommunicado\u2019. She says, \u201cIt sometimes seems that trying to get a return phone call &#8211; or anything more than a perfunctory text or email response &#8211; requires an act of Congress \u2026 if not an act of God.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s pretty clear what freelancers can do to overcome this issue, but Taylor recommends maintaining regular contact with clients and potential clients, routing your emails to your phone, and making sure that if you\u2019re away, you let clients know in advance and use auto-replies. \u201cOtherwise they\u2019ll just assume you\u2019re ignoring them, and will often go elsewhere as a result.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>2. Missed deadlines<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ve all had things crop up at the last minute that can interfere with deadlines, but clients suggest that you can build stronger relationships if you surprise them by delivering work early, or at the very least, communicate if there is going to be a problem.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gil Gildner, Cofounder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.discosloth.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discosloth<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says: \u201cI don&#8217;t think people realize how crucial it is to meet agreed-upon deadlines, otherwise an entire pipeline of work can be disrupted&#8230; so my biggest tip for freelancers is to make sure you over-deliver. Nobody will be upset at you for over-communicating or delivering a project early!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monica Eaton-Cardone also offers advice on meeting deadlines. \u201cI understand that you have other clients and other commitments\u2026 I even understand that my deadline could get pushed out from time to time. When that happens, however, a simple courtesy call explaining the situation can accomplish a lot in terms of gaining my confidence \u2026 and lowering my stress level!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>3. Scheduling work<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Juggling multiple projects also means it can be tough for freelancers to fit new tasks into their schedule as quickly as clients would like. While an in-house developer can quickly make an approved change to a website, a freelancer may need weeks before they\u2019re able to fit the work in.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stephen Hart, CEO at <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cardswitcher.co.uk\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cardswitcher<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> suggests working on retainers to address this. \u201cThe best solution I\u2019ve found is to hire freelancers on retainers, so every week I have five hours of their time ringfenced. If I get to the end of the week and haven\u2019t used that time for anything pressing, I dip into a backlog of proposed functionality and have them work on that. Working this way means we don\u2019t waste any time and changes can be made relatively quickly.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your clients aren\u2019t willing to work on a retainer basis, it again comes back to communication. Being clear with them about how long the task will take you, and why, allows them to set realistic expectations so no one is disappointed. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><strong>4. Working outside your expertise<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As freelancers, many of us have committed to a job that we weren\u2019t completely comfortable with when we\u2019ve really needed the work. But clients warn against doing this.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jason Lavis, Managing Director of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ootbinnovations.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of the Box Innovations<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says \u201cOften, a freelancer is keen to get a job, and they&#8217;ll agree to anything you ask, and promise that they can do everything. It&#8217;s challenging halfway through those projects when you realise that the work is miles away from what you want, with compromise an unlikely endpoint.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019ll be much better off if you specialize, according to Cristian Rennella, CEO &amp; CoFounder of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/omelhortrato.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">oMelhorTrato.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. \u201cThe freelancers who have invested the time to be the best in their area of work have been those that I have seen generate the best results in their professions\u2026 and also the ones with the most satisfied clients.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>5. Trying to do everything<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being clear about what you specialize in will also allow you to avoid spreading your skillset to thin.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFreelancers by nature are good at a wide variety of things. However, claiming to have marketable skills in a dozen different disciplines is misleading to us all,\u201d says Kevin Wenning of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/intentionallylost.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intentionally Lost<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhen a freelancer profile says they can do more than five things well I move on immediately, because that signals to me they can do one of those things well and the rest of them they have had some or little experience with\u2026 to give me the best result for my money, I need a freelancer to tell me what they have deep knowledge of and stop trying to tell me that they can do every last little thing for me. I&#8217;m very happy to pay somebody more to do one thing very very well.<\/span><b>\u201d<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b> <\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cristian Rennella agrees, suggesting that specializing in one particular job allows freelancers to charge more for their knowledge, \u201cas well as ensuring that the client is more satisfied by the quality of their work.\u201d <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than focusing on the short-term benefit of getting more work, focus on the long-term growth that your continued experience in one particular area can bring.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>6. Reliability<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not surprisingly, clients want to know they can count on you to get the job done. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But Kim Smith, Content Marketing Manager from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodfirms.co\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GoodFirms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, claims reliability is a major issue with many freelancers. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cFinding a content writer that is reliable in terms of quality, delivery and pricing was a difficult task for us. Searching for content writers on a reputed marketplace like Fiverr resolved our issue&#8230; We could check multiple things on this one platform \u2013 ratings, time taken in delivery, pricing, reviews of past clients and the best part \u2013 they could be contacted easily!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Her advice is to make sure you clearly understand your client\u2019s requirements, are clear about what you are going to provide and in what timeline, keep stakeholders informed, and are open to changes suggested by the client. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jarrod Partridge of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Idea Guru<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> also suggests being clear with clients about your deliverables. \u201cMy advice to freelancers would be to deliver what you say you will, and if you can&#8217;t do something or don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re being asked, please please please, just ask.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>7. Lack of trust<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with reliability comes trust, but often clients find it difficult to build this trust at the beginning. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nate <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Masterson<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Marketing Manager for <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mapleholistics.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maple Holistics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, says, \u201cthe key to hiring freelancers is to establish trust. How can this be achieved? By implementing &#8220;trial periods&#8221; before full employment is granted, or by bringing the worker in to work in-house for a predetermined period of time at the beginning of their employment (if possible).\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it\u2019s not feasible for you to offer a trial period, consider how you can build trust initially through word of mouth or reviews, either on your own website or on third party websites where you sell your services.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Build stronger client relationships<\/strong> <\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could any of these major client frustrations could have applied to you in the past? Consider whether there\u2019s something you could do to ensure your future projects avoid each of these scenarios. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re able to address these common client frustrations, you\u2019ll stand out alongside other freelancers, you\u2019ll build a much better working relationship with your clients, and you\u2019ll likely even manage to get some referrals! <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Word of mouth is the number source of the best clients for freelancers, according to a recent survey.
