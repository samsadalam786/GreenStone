Without missing a beat, I took the gig full-time and haven\u2019t looked back.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without overdoing it, I can honestly say starting a side-hustle has completely changed my life.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whether you need <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sidehustlenation.com\/ideas\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"side-hustle ideas (opens in a new tab)\">side-hustle ideas<\/a> to help you change your life situation, or just want a little more fun money, today I\u2019ve got 11 side-hustle ideas that you can actually start this weekend.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ideas DON\u2019T require a lot of startup capital or time and can turn a profit very quickly.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Become a freelancer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First on my list of side-hustle ideas is to become a freelancer. To <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/6-steps-to-starting-freelancing-from-scratch\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"start freelancing from scratch (opens in a new tab)\">start freelancing from scratch<\/a>, take a skill you\u2019re already good at and find a few companies or people who need your services.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is freelancing first on my list? Because I genuinely believe it\u2019s the quickest path to escaping your day job or making extra cash on the side.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good friend of mine recently lost his job and, within the first few days of being \u201cout of work,\u201d was able to drum up over $9,000 in freelance work just from his network of friends and family.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>His story, while inspiring, is extremely repeatable. The afternoon I lost my job, I booked $2,000 in work.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can freelance in just about anything too. If you\u2019re a designer, <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/10-steps-to-becoming-a-successful-freelance-designer\">bec<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/10-steps-to-becoming-a-successful-freelance-designer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"oming a freelance designer (opens in a new tab)\">oming a freelance designer<\/a> is extremely straightforward and good designers are always in high demand.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a writer, there\u2019s no shortage of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"remote writing jobs for beginners (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/freelance-writing-jobs-for-beginners\" target=\"_blank\">freelance writing jobs for beginners<\/a> all over the Internet.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your current skill set, I\u2019m willing to bet there are clients out there looking for what you have to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Do odd jobs on Fiverr<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhat if I\u2019m not a designer or a writer?\u201d you might be asking. That\u2019s fine. There are plenty of other freelancing opportunities for you out there.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fiverr (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/fiverr.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fiverr<\/a>, for example. Millions of people are making money on Fiverr doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/gigs\/weird\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"all sorts of bizarre things (opens in a new tab)\">all sorts of bizarre things<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a guy who gets paid to \u201c<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"say anything as a horse (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/fiverr.com\/oliverthenerd1\/say-anything-as-a-horse?ref_ctx_id=a225bd8f-849e-4c88-9e8a-482cb5e7651e\" target=\"_blank\">say anything as a horse<\/a>\u201d to someone who makes money by \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/shrewscream\/scream-at-people-and-objects?ref_ctx_id=a225bd8f-849e-4c88-9e8a-482cb5e7651e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"screaming at people and objects (opens in a new tab)\">screaming at people and objects<\/a>,\u201d you\u2019re only limited by your imagination.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Fiverr isn\u2019t just for the bizarre or unusual. Millions of freelancers are making really good money on Fiverr. <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/earning-33k-fiverr-taught-building-freelance-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"This Fiverr freelancer made $33K (opens in a new tab)\">This Fiverr freelancer made $33K<\/a> by experimenting on the platform.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re really serious about it, you can apply for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fiverr Pro (opens in a new tab)\">Fiverr Pro<\/a> where freelancers charge way more than just $5.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Sell (or flip) stuff on Craigslist<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re really short on time\u2014like, you need cash right this second\u2014then selling stuff (or flipping stuff) on Craigslist is a really great option.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, go around your house, in your attic or basement, and all around to find quality stuff you just don\u2019t use anymore.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll be surprised what kinds of items you can sell on Craigslist for some quick weekend money.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take it one step further, try browsing the \u201cfree\u201d sections on Craigslist to see what kind of treasures people throw away. Go pick them up and repost them in a relevant category where you can make a cool 100% profit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Drive people around<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the most common side-hustle ideas these days is to experiment with <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/gig-economy-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"gig economy jobs (opens in a new tab)\">gig economy jobs<\/a>. Among the most popular is becoming your own private taxi.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Applying to work with Lyft or Uber is something you can definitely tackle in a weekend and from there, you can decide your own availability and hours based on when you work and how much money you want to make.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Deliver food (or something else)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if being a taxi doesn\u2019t suit your interests, maybe you\u2019d prefer to run small errands for customers instead. Another very common gig economy job is that of delivering and running errands.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With apps like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"DoorDash (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.doordash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">DoorDash<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.taskrabbit.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"TaskRabbit (opens in a new tab)\">TaskRabbit<\/a>, you can deliver meals or perform other small tasks for customers in your spare time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>6. Become a virtual assistant<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of doing small odd jobs for customers, perhaps a more long-term side-hustle idea you\u2019d like to pursue is that of becoming a <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Virtual_assistant_(occupation)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"virtual assistant (opens in a new tab)\">virtual assistant<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, you\u2019d be hired by someone who needs regular help with small odd jobs in order to get their job done on a daily basis. In any given weekend, you might edit a document, update a PowerPoint presentation, order a salad, fill out a spreadsheet, or reply to an email.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fulltimenomad.com\/virtual-assistant-jobs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"sites you can use (opens in a new tab)\">sites you can use<\/a> to find your first virtual assistant job and, if you like it, you can scale up to work full-time from your own office or home.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>7. Sell (or resell) on Amazon<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a neighbor who works at a local grocery store. On the side, his wife and he scour thrift stores for used (or new) books they can sell on Amazon.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kicker? They make a cool $40,000 extra every year just from collecting, finding, and reselling books on Amazon.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried this idea out myself a few years ago and made about $700 just posting a few items here and there when I could. It made for a great little boost around Christmas time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/services.amazon.com\/selling\/getting-started.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Signing up to sell on Amazon (opens in a new tab)\">Signing up to sell on Amazon<\/a> is super quick and something you can definitely do to get started this weekend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>8. Teach something (anything) online<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If selling physical products isn\u2019t interesting to you, maybe you should pursue a side-hustle idea that\u2019s a bit more digital in nature.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you could become a teacher online. Sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Udemy (opens in a new tab)\">Udemy<\/a> allow you to upload your own video courses on any subject matter and start finding customers right away.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve created a quality video course (which admittedly may take longer than a weekend, but you could write out a basic outline this weekend!) all it takes is some regular promotion and it can turn into a nice stream of side-income for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to develop a course, you might consider teaching your native language online\u2014especially if you speak fluent English. Schools and programs in other countries pay online English tutors very well and have flexible schedules.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>9. Pick up litter<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want an extremely simple side-hustle idea you can start this weekend, I have the one for you:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking up trash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies in your communities have parking lots and campuses. And the last thing they want in their parking lots is a whole lot of garbage. So these companies pay individuals and other small companies to come pick up the litter on a regular basis.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sidehustlenation.com\/litter-pick-up-service\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"This guy (opens in a new tab)\">This guy<\/a> started picking up litter on the side of his day job and has grown his small business into a $650,000+\/year operation!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>10. House-sit, babysit, or pet-sit<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Need a side-hustle idea that will help you travel on the cheap? How about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nomadicmatt.com\/travel-blogs\/house-sitting\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"house-sitting (opens in a new tab)\">house-sitting<\/a>?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know there are people who will pay you to stay in their house while they\u2019re away on an extended trip or vacation?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019d rather sleep in your own bed at night, you can also try babysitting on the weekends, or pet-sitting too. With apps like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rover.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Rover (opens in a new tab)\">Rover<\/a>, you can sign up to pet-sit all the cuddly animals in your city.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>11. Make and sell something<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you need a side-hustle idea you can start this weekend, look no further than sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Etsy (opens in a new tab)\">Etsy<\/a> where you can create and post your hand-made items for sale to happy buyers.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rDxXBYqHEl8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"This college student makes an extra $5,000\/mo (opens in a new tab)\">This college student makes an extra $5,000\/mo<\/a> selling on Etsy. Not bad for a side-hustle idea you can sign up for in less than a weekend and manage with minimal time and effort.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s your ideal side-hustle?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s my list of side-hustle ideas you can start this weekend. My invitation is to go out there and figure out what side-hustle might work for you and give it a shot! <br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Side-hustle ideas you can start this weekend.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":110,"featured_media":8463,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[17],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>11 Side-hustle ideas you can start this weekend for some quick cash<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Side-hustle ideas you can start this weekend.
