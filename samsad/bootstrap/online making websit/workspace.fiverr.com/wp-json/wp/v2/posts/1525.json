That mode of support smoothly translates into the freelance world as well. To keep those creative muscles flexed, it helps to be surrounded by individuals who have similar goals and skills. For writers, the community is massive and offers ample destinations for you to contribute. From broad groups to niche, there&#8217;s likely a writing community out there for you right now.<br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t already belong to one, here are ten freelance communities worth checking out. Let\u2019s create together:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1865 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/fashion-legs-notebook-working.jpg\" alt=\"10 Great Online Communities for Freelance Writers freelance community, freelance writers, freelance writing jobs, communities for writers, writers groups, writing groups, Sologig, Envato Studio, SPJ Freelance Community, CloudPeeps, Hourly.com, Freelancer Community, Upwork, Facebook Groups, Slack, NaNoWriMo\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1068\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>For Sharing Ideas<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/nanowrimo.org\/pep-talks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>NaNoWriMo<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us who have been meaning to write that novel, but have never really gotten around to it, there\u2019s National Novel Writing Month. The name, conveniently, says it all. NaNoWriMo is a challenge to write a 50,000-word novel during the month of November. It sounds daunting, but you\u2019ll be in the thick of it with others crafting their own stories. As you make progress, you are awarded participation badges. When it feels like you\u2019ve hit a wall, there resources available\u2014 like in-house advice and \u201cpep talks\u201d from well-known authors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/freelance.chat\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Slack<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Imagine every instant messaging system you\u2019ve ever used: AIM, Skype, Gchat. Now, picture it being infinitely better. Slack is so special because it goes beyond instant messaging capabilities like your phone goes beyond\u2026 phone capabilities. For example, you can upload and share documents to get real-time edits and feedback. Organization between channel participants is also highly customizable, and instead of accumulating a list of contacts, you can just join a group. Our suggestion? #Freelance, which is a great way to have some company during those quiet days working along. It also helps that users will share ideas and client leads, too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/groups.fb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Facebook Groups<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to be outdone by Slack, behemoth social network Facebook has launched a similar web app called <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workplace.fb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workplace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, it hasn\u2019t become widely available yet, so if you want to get things done with the Blue and White you\u2019re most likely going to be working with Groups. Facebook Groups has grown drastically over the past few years. Today, they have become repositories for awesome link lists, and extensive Reddit-esque comment threads. There\u2019s also the possibility that someone could pass along a request for freelance work that is right up your alley!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>For the General Work Search<\/h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancer.com\/community\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Freelancer Community<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a community that prides itself on the idea that anything that you want done, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> get done. In that respect, it\u2019s sort of like Upwork, but Freelancer Community comes with its own integrated software that lets both the client and the freelancer track hours, progress, and communication. On top of that, it also includes a search engine that allows you to find the resources you need to develop new skills from UX to a new coding language.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hourly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Hourly.com<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a Freelancer\u2019s Social Network, with a generous splash of the matchmaking characteristics of Tinder. Many of the communities on this list make it the freelancer\u2019s responsibility to find work\u2014 you complete a profile, they set you up with the resources or the connections, and you make magic happen. But this works the other way. After creating your profile, you\u2019re matched to jobs that would seem like a good fit. Once there\u2019s mutual interest, you\u2019ll be contacted for an interview.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudpeeps.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>CloudPeeps<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p>This is a client-facing service that connects businesses with qualified freelancers. Instead of looking for the actual posting, users look for the \u201cPeeps\u201d (that\u2019s you, the freelancer), which displays their skillset and community rating. It\u2019s hidden away on the site, but they do have a page where you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cloudpeeps.com\/sign_up\/peep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sign up<\/a> to share your freelance talents!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tools-resources-for-freelancers\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5385\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/tools-and-resources-1-1.png\" alt=\"tools for freelancers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"224\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>The Niche Freelancer<\/h2>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.spj.org\/freelance.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>SPJ Freelance Community<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Society of Professional Journalists was founded in 1909 with the mission to \u201cinspire and educate journalists\u2026 and protect the First Amendment\u201d. It\u2019s awesome that they\u2019ve expanded and included some top-notch online resources for the freelancers among us, too. Building out a freelance career in journalism means that you\u2019ll need to develop a robust network, and SPJ has the tools to make that happen, thanks to the Freelance Community Chat and the Freelance Directory. Also of note is their \u201cJournalist\u2019s Toolbox\u201d, which is full of resources to elevate your stories and make them all the more appealing to editors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/studio.envato.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Envato Studio<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the makers of some seriously gorgeous WordPress themes comes Envato Studio, a freelance community built for graphic artists and designers. There is one caveat: the service providers are hand-picked by Envato. But once you\u2019re in, a world of opportunity will open with projects that span web design, audio, and mobile development. If you already have a solid portfolio and experience under your belt, it may do you well to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">register interest<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2026they just may contact you!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sologig.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Sologig<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CareerBuilder already made a name for themselves as one of the internet\u2019s largest job boards. Sologig is their venture into the engineering and IT professional niche. The layout is pretty barebones, and it\u2019s not particularly freelance-first. But those opportunities do exist on those boards\u2014 even engineering firms need technical writers and web developers!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know how it\u2019s way easier to go to get in shape when you have a buddy who is pushing you to go the extra mile,<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":56,"featured_media":10243,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>10 Great Online Communities for Freelance Writers<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"To keep creative muscles flexed, it helps to be surrounded by somebody who has similar goals and skills.
