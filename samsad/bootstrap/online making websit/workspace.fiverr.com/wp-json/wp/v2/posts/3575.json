I can write, I can film and edit videos, I can tell a story on a podcast, or I can present it through a speech or workshop. I\u2019ve taken this last avenue the\u00a0most, and after four years of doing so part-time, I&#8217;ve been able to move into speaking and consulting full-time. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The leap was not an easy one, but it\u2019s a space that a lot of people are curious about breaking into. So, to save you some time and heartache, I want to share some of my top tips for adding speaking into your freelancer repertoire.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Do an audit on your niche<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a freelancer, it quickly becomes essential to work within a niche. This helps streamline your process of scouting and bidding for gigs, developing expertise, and delivering high-quality work. Do some research within your chosen niche for possible topics to speak on. Don\u2019t just think about what you\u2019re good at and what you have experience in; find where there might be gaps in knowledge or areas that aren\u2019t being talked about.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can fill one of those gaps, or provide additional support to a target audience in need of information, then you\u2019ve found where you should start!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Start small, with remixes of existing content<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve narrowed down your niche and what you want your talks to cover, you have to figure out what you want to say. I find that the easiest way to do this, is to go through your content and see what has engaged the most users. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for likes or comments on blogs, emails with questions, or poll your current clients or target audience using your Facebook page, email newsletter, or even tools like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wedgies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wedgies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to conduct polls across platforms. Sharing your most popular content in a new venue, supplemented with new details and more opportunities for participants to engage with you, can be a great way to get a speaking career moving. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Practice, practice, practice<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before I entered the speaker circuit, I had the opportunity to book speakers on college campuses several times a year. In doing\u00a0this, I learned\u00a0there&#8217;s a difference between those with a good story, and those who can <em>tell<\/em> a good story<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Individuals in the second group, as you might imagine, are far more compelling and memorable to watch than those with good experiences but no idea how to make them interesting\u00a0for the audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only way to move from the first group, to the second, is practice. Practice on tape or in front of friends, invite feedback (good and bad!), and then adapt your performance based on the feedback you receive. This process is humbling at first, but you\u2019ll get more comfortable the more you do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Cull and contact your network<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armed with a topic, a method of delivery, and an idea of how to tell your story, you can now start reaching out to people who might be interested in your services as a speaker. <\/span><br \/>\nA word of warning: there is a difference between people you know, and people who can benefit from your services. It is easy to conflate the two, but I find it\u2019s much more effective to contact folks who you know are challenged in the area you cover, and speak specifically to a demonstrated need.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The specificity does narrow your outreach opportunities, but it also shows you\u2019ve done your research and have an understanding of the organization. As with any client you\u2019re hoping to land, this differentiating factor matters. And once you land these initial clients, be sure to keep in touch with them to find out how they use the information you present and how it changes the way they work or exist. Those testimonials will be invaluable as you start looking to speak to clients who aren\u2019t familiar with you or your work. If they hear from someone else that you\u2019re good, that word-of-mouth could help them choose you!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Be open to working in kind<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be clear: I am a strong advocate in being paid what you\u2019re worth for the work you do. However, I also recognize that early on in a new niche or area, some flexibility does exist in this arena. Starting with conferences, panels, or local events gives you the opportunity to build your skills as a speaker, and offers the exposure (I know, I cringed at the word, too) that can lead to paying gigs. But early on, if prospective clients are reluctant to pay you, consider discounting your price but also asking for in kind items that can benefit you early in a speaking career. Examples include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professional-quality photos or videos of your talk (if this is offered, don\u2019t accept cell phone versions, have them spring to do it with a real camera)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multi-paragraph testimonial about their booking and day-of experience<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A concrete number of referrals to future clients<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Access to facilities that can provide marketing materials<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With that said, after a certain point these sorts of in kind exchanges will be harder to justify. \u00a0When you do reach that point, commit to having clients pay you what you\u2019re worth\u2014as with so many other things, it&#8217;s not just about the final product but the labor and preparation it takes to get to it.<\/p>\n<h3>Cement your offerings<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have a topic. You\u2019re practiced. You\u2019re road-tested. Time to make it official. On your website, in your portfolio, and on your LinkedIn, Behance or other online profiles, declare yourself open for business. Create a form where people can reach you to inquire about availability and pricing. Include the testimonials you\u2019ve collected so people know how you\u2019ve been received in the past. If possible, include photos and a video of you speaking.
