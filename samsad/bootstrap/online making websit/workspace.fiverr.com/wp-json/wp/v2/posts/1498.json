There\u2019s another component for freelancing success that can\u2019t be found on a job board. That\u2019s the support of other freelancers in your niche who can give you advice on running your business. You need a freelance community.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the freelancing life has an air of independence, sometimes we need help from others. This could be for a job or it could be just to commiserate about the ups and downs of the lifestyle. There are several places freelancers go to have their own private \u201cbreak room\u201d to swap tips. We\u2019re going to share a few of those for developers (and related design groups) with you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Slack for Devs<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slack<\/a> is an obvious one to some, and that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the most popular place to build a freelance community, hands down. If you haven\u2019t used Slack, consider it to be the next level up from the traditional forum. Slack\u2019s original purpose was to allow real-time collaboration between teams for project management, but there are now thousands of groups where people with similar interests come to chat and share ideas.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the benefits of Slack is that the groups can be quite granular. Unlike a freelancing forum on a job board site, you can really drill down. Here are a few examples:<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/ios-developers.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/ios-developers.io\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (iOS developers)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/alexnab.github.io\/android-united\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/alexnab.github.io\/android-united\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Android developers)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/frontenddevelopers.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/frontenddevelopers.org\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Front-end web development)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fedsonslack\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/fedsonslack<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Another Front-end development group)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sass-chat.herokuapp.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/sass-chat.herokuapp.com\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Software as a Service development)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bit.ly\/rubyslack\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/bit.ly\/rubyslack<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Ruby development)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/larachat.co\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/larachat.co\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Laravel framework)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bootstrap-slack.herokuapp.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/bootstrap-slack.herokuapp.com\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Bootstrap development)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are also more general groups, such as:<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hashtagfreelance.co\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/hashtagfreelance.co\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (General freelance community)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.designerhangout.co\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.designerhangout.co\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Slack group for designers, great for front-end)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/codenewbie.typeform.com\/to\/uwsWlZ\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/codenewbie.typeform.com\/to\/uwsWlZ<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Code newbie)<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/uiux.community\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/uiux.community\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (UI\/UX)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of these groups have strict sign-up policies. Others are more open. Explore these groups and Slack to find others that are active and have a sizeable population.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Facebook for Devs<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook is another place to find freelancing groups, though it is not nearly as popular. Facebook\u2019s interface doesn\u2019t allow for good group collaboration like Slack does. Most attempts to create freelancer groups on Facebook end up turning into job boards eventually or become closed\/private to prevent people from trying to turn them into one. This is the main reason why Slack is far more popular for freelance communities.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many freelance communities on Facebook are actually extensions from another site selling services or offering content. For instance, the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/beingboss\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being Boss<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> group is a place for freelancers to discuss the latest podcast from that site. That doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t useful, but you have to be choosy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One group that is development-focused is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/477745542374973\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unstoppable Basecamp<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is a group for web developers and designers with very strict entrance policies. Be sure to read the sidebar to see if you qualify. You might have to do a big revamp of your profile before attempting to join! <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another group that might be of interest is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/SimplifiedSystems\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simplified Systems<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This is a group that shares systems for simplifying businesses. It could be an excellent place to get ideas for new web-based tools. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Github<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another way for developers to network is to start participating in projects on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.github.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Github<\/a>. Github is a place for people to create and collaborate on open source software projects using the Git VCS. Due to its focus on coding, most of the people you find there will be developers of one sort or another. Collaborating with someone on a project will build your skills and your portfolio. Get a good reputation on Github for open source contribution and you\u2019ll start making a lot of contacts.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best way to start is to learn Git and then dive into a project by offering improvements. Git does have a learning curve, but grasping good Git etiquette is pretty easy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Professional Dev Organizations<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There aren\u2019t many professional organizations for the overall freelance developer community. Granted, there are the excellent general organizations like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Freelancers Union<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0(US) or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipse.co.uk\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IPSE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (UK), and those might be good places to seek out others. Depending on your personal programming niche, your language might have their own professional organization. However, it\u2019s not likely to be freelancing specific. If you are a front-end developer, you might want to consider joining <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.aiga.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AIGA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a long-standing professional organization for designers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you a developer and you have a place you like to hang out with other freelancers? Let us know in the comments. We may fold your information into an updated version of this article. Until that time, we really suggest starting to explore what Slack groups and Github have to offer, as that is where you will get the most reward for your efforts.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re a developer, we\u2019re hoping that you\u2019ve found an excellent source for leads.
