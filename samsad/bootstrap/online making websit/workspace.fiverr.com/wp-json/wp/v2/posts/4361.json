It\u2019s hard to deny that some people honestly work better with a structure, and working for yourself for the first time might make you feel like you don\u2019t have one. After all, who\u2019s going to get mad at you if you spend the workday taking a nap, bingeing your favorite Netflix shows, or playing hooky for the afternoon?<br \/>\nIn order to be your own boss and find success as a freelancer, you\u2019ll need to create some rules for yourself. Once you proactively work to create this structure, you\u2019ll find that you can be your own boss&#8230; and enjoy it.<br \/>\nHere are 10 rules to create for yourself as a freelancer working for yourself for the first time.<\/p>\n<h2>Set a Schedule &#8211; and Stick to it!<\/h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re your own boss, you\u2019ll feel tempted to do whatever you want, whenever you want. But you\u2019ll make the transition easier and more successful if you work to maintain a similar structure to how you worked at your 9-5. In fact, you\u2019ll have <em>more<\/em> time to spend on freelancing <em>without<\/em> hurting an ideal work\/life balance. If you <a href=\"https:\/\/plan.io\/blog\/post\/160946096878\/10-ways-to-be-productive-working-from-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">work from home<\/a>, you can use the time you might spend getting ready for work or commuting to grow your business.<br \/>\nEventually, you can take advantage of the freedoms that come with freelancing, but it\u2019s important to put in the hard work first. Your schedule might eventually morph from the typical 9-5, to 10-2, and 3-6, or whatever works best for you. Having an atypical schedule is perfectly fine if it\u2019s conducive to finishing projects.<br \/>\nAnd while you\u2019re creating a schedule, make sure to schedule in some time for breaks! They\u2019re absolutely necessary to avoid burnout, and are frequently forgotten by new freelancers trying to throw themselves into things completely.<br \/>\nWhile you\u2019re working on your schedule, make sure to clue in clients as well. Make it a habit to avoid answering calls\/emails outside of your set work hours, unless it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s an emergency situation that requires your assistance.<br \/>\nIf you condition clients to expect answers on nights\/weekends, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot as far as maintaining the ideal work\/life balance. That said, if you plan on working nights\/weekends, an email scheduling tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.boomeranggmail.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Boomerang<\/a> can help you get stuff done, but clients will get the results of your efforts during your normal work hours.<\/p>\n<h2>Wake up Early<\/h2>\n<p>This is especially important when you\u2019re just getting started. Eventually, you can settle into a schedule that fits your own unique circadian rhythm, but the more you can mirror your past work habits, the easier (and more successful) your transition will be. If you wait to start work at 11am, you might panic at how quickly the afternoon comes and your workable time is essentially over. Freedom comes with a price!<\/p>\n<h2>Work on the Hardest Tasks First<\/h2>\n<p>As the day goes on, it\u2019ll get harder to use your brain (not to mention a need to handle additional distractions that will inevitably come up), so do yourself a favor and crush out those hard tasks first. All of your additional tasks for the day will seem like a walk in the park in comparison, and it\u2019s probably safe to say that your mood will get better and better as the day winds down and your to do list gets easier.<br \/>\nWith regards to scheduling tasks, don\u2019t try to force yourself to accomplish too much in one day. Pick three non-negotiable tasks, then everything else you\u2019re able to get done will feel like a bonus.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn How to Say, \u201cNo\u201d<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re just getting started on your own, it\u2019s tempting to say yes to every opportunity that presents itself. And when it means expanding your network, like by attending certain events, you should make time for these opportunities. But when it means someone wants to take you out to coffee to pick your brain, this jam session will likely benefit the other person while simultaneously taking away from your ability to build your business\u2014and make money!<br \/>\nIn fact, kill two birds with one stone and cut down on wasted meeting times by charging for them. For new clients, build pricing for your time spent on meetings into the contract, and charge for any additional meetings needed past that.<br \/>\nThis will encourage clients to communicate more over email, which you can then respond to at your leisure. If someone still wants a meeting when there\u2019s a price tag attached, that might actually be a signal that the meeting <em>can<\/em> be good for your business.<br \/>\nLearning how to say no also means saying no to friends who invite you out for lunch or fun on a workday because they know you\u2019re \u201cfree.\u201d Again, it\u2019s fine to indulge occasionally, but don\u2019t make it a habit if you plan on being a freelancer for longer than a few months!<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Start Work without a Contract<\/h2>\n<p>&#8230;And ideally, a deposit!<br \/>\nIt\u2019s worth saying again\u2014when you be your own boss, you\u2019re the <em>only<\/em> person who\u2019s going to care what happens to you. There\u2019s no legal department or HR person to make sure that all the i\u2019s are dotted and t\u2019s are crossed. <strong>You<\/strong> need to be the one who proactively protects yourself. Start with these essential contract clauses, and use <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/contracts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a tool<\/a> that can make sure you\u2019ve covered every necessary piece.<\/p>\n<h2>Own Your Mistakes<\/h2>\n<p>About to miss a deadline? Not as far along on a project as you had planned to be?<br \/>\nBe honest with the client, instead of waiting until the problem is unfixable. We\u2019re all human and your clients will understand as long as you don\u2019t make it a habit, or if you\u2019re honestly not at fault.<br \/>\nOn that note, set internal due dates that are well ahead of the <em>actual<\/em> due date to mitigate this potential issue. Use some type of task management tool to manage due dates in an organized fashion.<\/p>\n<h2>Go Above and Beyond<\/h2>\n<p>Delivering a final project that is more than a client expected and blows them away is the best type of marketing that will keep clients coming back for more. Why hire another freelancer if you consistently deliver work that shows you\u2019re willing to go above and beyond the basic level of expectation?<\/p>\n<h2>Become an Analytics Junkie<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re not tracking growth, how will you know that it\u2019s happening? A few things you should create systems to measure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Track time<\/a> and corresponding earnings to determine your rate per hour. Compare how this rate differs from client to client as your time starts to fill up, and you want to determine which clients might not make sense to keep around if there are more lucrative projects on the line that pay a better rate.<\/li>\n<li>Track earnings (both billed and paid) month over month to determine when you need to hustle for a few more jobs (although you should <em>always<\/em> be hustling\u00a0since client churn is inevitable).<\/li>\n<li>Track social media growth if you\u2019re using these mediums to grow your personal brand\/drive leads to your website. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cyfe.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cyfe<\/a> is a dynamic dashboard that you can set and forget for this purpose.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Treat Yourself Like a Client<\/h2>\n<p>In the flurry of trying to please clients and grow your business, it\u2019s easy to forget\/put off your own personal branding efforts. But investing time and energy into your personal brand can be a necessary tactic for attracting higher quality (and higher paying!) clients, making money with affiliate marketing, or building an audience for other passive income activities.<br \/>\nSo don\u2019t let your social media, blog, or email list sit complacently for too long. <em>Every<\/em> business has to do some level of marketing\/sales to stay in business, and you\u2019re no exception!<\/p>\n<h2>Be Discriminating with the Clients You Work with<\/h2>\n<p>If your gut is saying something isn\u2019t right, it probably isn\u2019t. Be your own boss and learn to identify and listen to red flags for your own sanity. It\u2019s not always easy to recognize these things at the beginning of a relationship, but learn how to get out of a bad situation if it\u2019s affecting your mental health. After all, that\u2019s the beauty of freelancing. You don\u2019t have to work with anyone who doesn\u2019t seem to understand the value you\u2019re bringing to their business.<\/p>\n<h2>Be Your Own Boss<\/h2>\n<p>Be your own boss. It may seem like a pipe dream at first, but you\u2019ll grow into it by creating rules that can be broken after you\u2019ve created a good basic structure.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the hardest transitions for new freelancers to make is the transition to be your own boss.
