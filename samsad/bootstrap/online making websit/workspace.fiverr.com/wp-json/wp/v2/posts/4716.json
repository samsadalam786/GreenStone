Fortunately, there are solutions. From creating a healthy work-life balance to preparing for tax season, here we recap the 10 biggest challenges remote employees and freelancers face on a regular basis, and\u2014more importantly\u2014how to solve them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Lacking community<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> While you might not think twice about leaving the office life behind, lacking the exposure to a community of colleagues and collaborators is one of the most cited complaints among remote workers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> Be proactive about building a community of peers with similar lifestyles and remote setups. How you choose to approach this is completely up to you. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Coworking spaces<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> provide engaging and lively areas to work and socialize, and a majority of the memberships are held by remote workers, meaning that you\u2019ll instantly be amongst peers. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another popular go-to for remote workers is leaning on technology to help with networking, and these online interactions can often lead to in-person meetups between members. Sites like Facebook and Meetup, for instance, have specific remote work channels for different cities around the globe.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Creating a work-life balance<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> When your home is your office, it can be difficult to \u201cturn off\u201d at the end of the workday. Outside of the parameters of a normal work life, checking emails at all hours of the day and working overtime from your home office can quickly become part of the routine.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> Just because you\u2019re working from home doesn\u2019t mean that you should always be working. The quickest way to burn out as a remote worker is to never allow yourself to take needed breaks, and that\u2019s why having a healthy work-life balance is so important. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s a remote worker to do? Create rules for yourself. Whether it\u2019s informing your team that you\u2019ll be unavailable after 6 p.m. on work days, not allowing yourself to work once the sun goes down, or promising yourself two full days a week to be work-free, putting structure into your life to ensure a healthy work-life balance is a must.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Finding work<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> If you\u2019re a freelancer, you may find yourself constantly looking for work and picking up new gigs every few months. Finding work can be especially challenging as a remote worker living a nomad lifestyle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> One of the most exciting aspects of being a freelancer is that you\u2019re working on different projects (and for different people) all the time, but acquiring new work often means seeking out new work. Networking is one of the most important aspects when it comes to finding new clients. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To that end, joining a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/remote.com\/jobs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remote job database platform<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be extremely useful in finding legitimate, paying work. Sites like Remote.com use artificial intelligence to help align professional remote workers with managing remote hirers in their field. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. Keeping in touch<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> When you\u2019re off-the-grid and working independently, it can be easy to go days without communicating with your team.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> Make an active effort to update your manager on a daily or weekly basis, even if it\u2019s only with a summary email. Free tools like Google Hangouts and Skype make face-to-face communication between remote teams a breeze. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Further, tools like Slack and Trello provide a way for entire teams to remain in communication and on the same page about work. Many remote teams also use such tools provide social communication for their remote employees, creating \u201cwater cooler channels\u201d for non-work related discussion.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. Lacking motivation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> Sometimes, when there\u2019s nobody looking over your shoulder, you might lack the needed motivation to get things done on your own time.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution: When you\u2019re working remotely, staying productive is key to your success. Everybody runs into moments when they\u2019re lacking the motivation to get work done, but if it becomes a long-term issue, you may want to consider restricting yourself from common distractions.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Productivity apps<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0exist for the sole purpose of keeping people on track. <a href=\"https:\/\/freedom.to\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freedom<\/a> is one of the best, allowing you to lock yourself out of distracting social media websites (or the entire web if need be!) for set periods of time. Need help prioritizing? Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/task-manager\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Task Manager<\/a> bumps up your most pressing tasks first, allowing you to push other tasks off your plate for the time being.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6. Staying organized<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> If you work for multiple clients, you likely have a lot of client information to stay on top of, proving to be a challenge for those who struggle with organization. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> Creating a system that works for your workflow is the best way to go about staying organized when you\u2019re dealing with multiple clients. Whether that entails using a software system, being heavy-handed on spreadsheets, or using a printed organizer is up to you and how you best work.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best piece of advice here is to stay organized from the get-go. Once you fall behind on keeping track of your mounting tasks and projects, it can be a hassle to try and catch-up on\u00a0the details. Save yourself the headache\u00a0and creating a system that works for you from Day 1.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. Getting paid<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> Getting paid as a freelancer can be tricky, and tracking down payments often becomes a struggle if you aren\u2019t being paid within a reasonable 30-day period.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution<\/em>: Don\u2019t be afraid to continually check-in on your payments from your contracted gigs. Additionally, using third-party sites that use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/help.remote.com\/recruiting-hiring-and-contract-payment\/hiring-and-paying-freelancers\/paying-freelancers-payment-protection\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">payment processors<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are ideal for making sure you\u2019ll be paid before you even complete your work. Escrow accounts help facilitate quick, safe, and easy payment options for remote workers. Have a particularly tricky late-paying client? Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Williams&amp;Harricks tool<\/a> allows you to send a physical demand letter for $3.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re working full-time for a company and still not receiving your payments on a regular timeline, talk to your supervisor or the HR department about confirming a consistent pay plan. Many remote employees will also put their workload on hold if their employers are behind payment of more than 90 days. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8. Preparing your taxes<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenge: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A majority of part-time and contract remote gigs pay without withholding taxes, which means that being prepared for tax season becomes important long before April 15. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> Keep track of your numbers. If you\u2019re not having taxes taken out of your paychecks, you\u2019ll want to self-calculate how much you\u2019ll owe in taxes on each paycheck and set that money aside. Many freelancers also choose to pay quarterly, which is advised by the U.S. government to avoid paying a late fee penalty. Not sure what to save? There&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/quarterly-tax-calculator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a free calculator<\/a> for that.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">keeping track of your deductions<\/a> and work expenses throughout the year (rather than trying to remember them all while you\u2019re filing your taxes) is a smart move to make. Be sure to hang on to any relevant receipts or paperwork.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">9. Feeling isolated<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Challenge:<\/em> Along with feeling like you\u2019re lacking an office community, working from home all day can also have you feeling physically isolated.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution:<\/em> One great (and affordable) solution for those feeling isolated or going a little stir-crazy in their home is to head to a local coffee shop or library to make use of the free WiFi amid a mellow, yet productive, environment. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you prefer to work from home, set aside time to take brief walks around your neighborhood during the day to escape the confines of a quiet home. Making trips to the grocery store, local parks, or a neighbor\u2019s house can provide you with social environments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10. Keeping track of your earnings<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Challenge: <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re receiving an income from multiple sources, it can be easy to start cashing checks without <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">taking note of the totals<\/a>, leaving you in a bind later on when you want to assess your earnings.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Solution<\/em>: Either creating your own spreadsheet or using <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/reports\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelance accounting software<\/a> where you can enter in your financial earnings from various employers is ideal for keeping track of your income and its sources. This type of information is important not only for allowing you a simple way to assess your income, but it also helps ensure that you\u2019re not missing any paychecks or direct deposits in the shuffle of things.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always be certain that you\u2019re keeping track of your projected income, as well as what individual clients should be paying you.<\/span><br \/>\nRemote work comes with challenges, but along with those come incredible opportunities for personal and professional growth.
