The participants spanned a wide range of professions (from creatives and coders to consultants and content specialists, and everything in between) and regions. Our mission was to get inside the minds of today\u2019s freelancers so we could better understand what challenges and inspires them and what makes them tick.<\/p>\n<p>Freelancers are typically regarded as people who are in between jobs, floating aimlessly from gig to gig. As we hypothesized, that couldn\u2019t be further from reality for today\u2019s independent workforce.<br \/>\nIn analyzing the data, we found that\u00a095 percent the freelancers we surveyed sell multiple skills\u00a0within their\u00a0careers (e.g. \u201cDesigner \/ Coder \/ Event Planner\u201d). Slash Workers, whose talents\u00a0are multifaceted and wide-ranging, represent the newest breed in today\u2019s gig economy\u2014and the results of our study shed light on their story.<\/p>\n<p>The people\u00a0we surveyed also see\u00a0freelancing as a career path, not a career <em>placeholder<\/em>, as the stigma would suggest. <strong>Just 6 percent of survey respondents indicated they were freelancing until a full-time gig came along.<\/strong> Another 41 percent told us\u00a0they intend freelance forever.<\/p>\n<p>And what about their feelings toward their financial stability and the overall stressors that the independent life brings with it? Not surprisingly, only 23\u00a0percent of respondents feel more financially stable\u00a0since going independent, however\u00a0<strong>68 percent of them said that, in spite of this, their quality of life has improved<\/strong>. For freelancers, freedom is the new wealth.<\/p>\n<p>Some of the other findings include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The No. 1 reason respondents say they went independent was for \u201cpersonal growth\u201d and just 6 percent\u00a0say they did it for the financial upside.<\/li>\n<li>60 percent of respondents say they would <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">consider adopting a nomadic lifestyle in the future.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Male respondents were 4.5x more likely to earn more than $150,000+ a year than female respondents, but more men said they had been stiffed by a client.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And how about what\u2019s missing? For one, freelancers say they want a little more respect\u00a0(60 percent say the freelance stigma is alive and well). In addition, they\u2019re looking for a sense of community and more remote work options.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Check out the full study at <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/slash-workers\"
