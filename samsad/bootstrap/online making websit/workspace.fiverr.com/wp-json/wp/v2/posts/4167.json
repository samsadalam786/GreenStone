But once you\u2019ve established yourself, generated multiple income streams, and have rates that are high enough to leave you with a little free time,&nbsp;it could be worth it to try generating passive income.<\/p>\n<p>Generating passive income can be more difficult than generating active income, but if you\u2019re successful enough, all you have to do is sit back and watch the money roll in.<br \/>\nThere are endless ways to generate passive income depending on the field you work in, your expertise, and your creativity.<\/p>\n<p>But, before you get started, heed <a href=\"https:\/\/brentgalloway.me\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">graphic designer Brent Galloway\u2019s<\/a> advice: \u201cAlways focus on generating a steady stream of income first. But this doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t work on generating passive income at the same time. The beautiful thing with passive income is that you can work it in-between projects. The goal, though, is to have your main source of income fuel your side projects.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Good advice. Now let\u2019s look at some ways that freelancers can generate passive income.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=The%20beautiful%20thing%20with%20passive%20income%20is%20that%20you%20can%20work%20it%20in-between%20projects.%20%23freelance%20%23passiveincome&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The beautiful thing with passive income is that you can work it in-between projects. #freelance #passiveincome <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=The%20beautiful%20thing%20with%20passive%20income%20is%20that%20you%20can%20work%20it%20in-between%20projects.%20%23freelance%20%23passiveincome&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Sell digital assets to generate passive income<\/h3>\n<p>Galloway has employed some key strategies that have helped him generate passive income as a freelance graphic designer.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe most effective way I\u2019ve found to generate passive income has been through selling digital assets,\u201d said Galloway. \u201cThings like textures, mockups, vector graphics, etc. They\u2019re simple products to put together, and in most cases, you might already have your own assets which could easily be packaged and sold on a platform like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/creativemarket.com\/?u=brentgalloway\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creative Market<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But where do you start? Thing of the old adage: How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. When you\u2019re done with a project for a client and find yourself with a few hours to pass, start by building one product that you think would be valuable to the wider world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI recommend starting small. What assets have you created for yourself that makes your job easier? Chances are those assets could also be of value to others in your field of work. For me, I started with a very simple&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/crmrkt.com\/E4k9D\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">texture pack<\/a>,\u201d said Galloway. \u201cI also built my own&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/crmrkt.com\/J74jV\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">t-shirt mockups<\/a>&nbsp;for my work, which I then repackaged as a premium asset for other designers. I didn\u2019t build it with the intent to make money off of it. I had a need, so I built it. But then realized if I had this need, chances were other designers could use this asset too.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Once&nbsp;you\u2019ve created a few digital assets to generate passive income, and if they&#8217;re beginning to sell, you can ramp up your production in those markets. Since they\u2019re all digital, there\u2019s no cost associated with production\u2014if your digital products aren\u2019t selling, you can always change your focus and try something else, or try what you\u2019re doing differently. Your attempts at generating passive income will be unique to you and will naturally have to work as an experiment, but if you keep plugging away at it, you will eventually get it right.<\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Create online courses to generate passive income<\/h3>\n<p>Online learning is a huge industry. As in, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tjmccue\/2014\/08\/27\/online-learning-industry-poised-for-107-billion-in-2015\/#1d2883877103\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">100+ billion dollars per year huge.<\/a> As a freelancer, you have developed skills that hundreds, thousands, or millions of other people would like to develop themselves. Creating online courses is a way to teach what you know while also generating a passive income.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=Creating%20online%20courses%20is%20a%20way%20to%20teach%20what%20you%20know%20while%20also%20generating%20a%20passive%20income.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Creating online courses is a way to teach what you know while also generating a passive income. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=Creating%20online%20courses%20is%20a%20way%20to%20teach%20what%20you%20know%20while%20also%20generating%20a%20passive%20income.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theinternationalfreelancer.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">journalist Mridu Khullar Relph<\/a>, when it comes to generating passive income, \u201cOnline products, whether in the form of courses or workshops or webinars, are generally the best way. The key thing with online products is that people buy them to get a specific result, so if your program (whatever form it takes) can help lead them to that result, it can be a great way to build some extra income.\u201d<br \/>\nYou might not end up as lucky as the math teacher who <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thepennyhoarder.com\/jobs-making-money\/side-gigs\/how-to-create-online-courses\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">earned more than $1 million<\/a> after creating only four online courses, but you can, with concentrated effort, generate thousands of dollars per month in passive income through the creation of online courses.<\/p>\n<p>Not every course will earn you money, though. Like anything in life, sometimes your efforts will not be rewarded, and creating online courses can take a lot of time. That\u2019s why it&#8217;s wise to heed the advice above and make sure you have steady sources of active income\u2014then you can spend some of your free time working on creating an online course. Worst case scenario, you learn a lot about yourself or pick up some new skills from creating your first course. Best case scenario, you learn a lot about yourself, pick up some new skills, and earn a whole lot of passive income.<\/p>\n<h3>Blog to generate passive income<\/h3>\n<p>This is one of the most crowded fields on the planet, but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t go for it\u2014especially because the benefits of creating your own blog are two-fold.<br \/>\nThe truth is, for every blog that earns a sizable income, there are thousands that do not. But your blog can be created first as a means of <a href=\"https:\/\/thebrandedsolopreneur.com\/blogging-to-build-your-brand\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">building your own brand<\/a> and driving clients to your services, which can increase your active income. Then, as your posts begin to lead to more engagement, you can turn your blog into a source of both active and <a href=\"https:\/\/smartblogger.com\/passive-income\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">passive income<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use your blog to drive other passive income sources like the online courses and digital assets you have created.<\/p>\n<h3>Write eBooks to generate passive income<\/h3>\n<p>As with most sources of passive income, there is a level of dedication required to make writing eBooks work. Your content has to be valuable to potential customers. You have to do marketing. You have to become a trusted source of information, or develop a niche. The topics you can write about are endless\u2014from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Taken-T-Rex-Dinosaur-Erotica-Christie-ebook\/dp\/B00FI9JFFO\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1494336969&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=dinosaur+romance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dinosaur-themed romance novels<\/a> (yes, this is real, and seems to really sell\u2026) to eBooks about how to write and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Passive-Income-Every-Kindle-Publishing-ebook\/dp\/B010191J3Q\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generate passive income from eBooks<\/a> (perhaps you can go even more meta and write an eBook about how to write eBooks about writing eBooks).<br \/>\nJoking aside, if you\u2019ve always wanted to write a book, there\u2019s never been a time in history when it\u2019s been so easy to get your work out there. You can also take a highly-rated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.udemy.com\/how-to-retire-early-by-publishing-and-selling-kindle-ebooks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Udemy course on the subject.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Design WordPress themes and plugins to generate passive income<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re good with WordPress, then there\u2019s a huge market out there. The field may be crowded, but if a few themes or plugins that you have designed take off, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpexplorer.com\/make-money-with-wordpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generate a nice passive income<\/a> from them.<br \/>\nYou can check out <a href=\"https:\/\/chriswharton.me\/2015\/07\/selling-commercial-wordpress-themes-a-real-life-story\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelancer Chris Wharton\u2019s story<\/a> to see how his passive income from creating WordPress themes went from just under $10,000 in 2012 to nearly $50,000 in 2014.<\/p>\n<p>No matter which of these potential routes you choose to take to generate passive income as a freelancer, you will be faced with a challenge before you see any money roll in. First, you must create something new, useful, and marketable, and then you have to get the word out.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=To%20generate%20passive%20income%2C%20you%20must%20create%20something%20new%2C%20useful%2C%20and%20marketable.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">To generate passive income, you must create something new, useful, and marketable. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income%2F&#038;text=To%20generate%20passive%20income%2C%20you%20must%20create%20something%20new%2C%20useful%2C%20and%20marketable.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it requires plugging away at it for months before you see any of the fruits of your efforts.
