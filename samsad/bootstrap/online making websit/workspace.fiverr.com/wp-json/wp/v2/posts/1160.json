And then forget all about it until the next time they\u2019re applying to a job.<br \/>\nAnd five years later, there that portfolio sits, packed with outdated content and screenshots that \u2026 Nobody. Ever. Looks at.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let\u2019s take a look at a few of the most common mistakes designers make with their portfolios \u2014 and how you can overcome them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Mistake 1: Lacking a clearly defined purpose<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All too often, designers act on the knowledge that they <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">should<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have a portfolio without really considering <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you\u2019d <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">never<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> do that on a professional project, right? In your \u201creal,\u201d paid work, you always investigate use cases, user journeys, and workflows. And there\u2019s no reason not to put the same level of effort into building your personal design portfolio.<\/span><br \/>\nIn fact, if you\u2019re a freelancer, you should be doing even more.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So before you sketch a single screen or diagram one simple flow, take some time to define your portfolio\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">purpose<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Ask yourself:<\/span><br \/>\n<b>Why am I building this website?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you want to attract freelance clients, build your personal build, get an awesome in-house job, or just have the best-looking blog on the planet? Note that it\u2019s helpful to be really specific here. If you\u2019re looking for freelance clients or an in-house job, what sort of client\/job do you want? The answer could do a lot to shape how you design the site, and what sort of tone you take in the content. <\/span><br \/>\n<b>Who do I expect to visit it? How will they get there?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This should flow straight from the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but answering it will help you understand where to invest your energies and shape your content strategy. If you want to build your personal brand amongst other designers, frequent blogs with custom illustrations that you then post to Dribbble, Twitter, and Designer News would make a lot of sense. Someone looking for clients to build restaurant websites for will have a completely different answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What do I want them to do once they get there?<\/b><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for freelance clients, you\u2019ll want to show off your past work, include some testimonials, possibly some info on your rates, and a contact form. Looking for an in-house job? You\u2019ll need a lot of the same content \u2014 but in terms of functionality, your personal email and phone number might be better than a contact form.<\/span><br \/>\nNow, it can be easy to look at a list of questions like that and think: Well, duh. The answer to every one of these is obvious. And yes, that\u2019s probably true.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But by taking the time to think through these questions, you\u2019ll crystalize your thinking not only your goal for your portfolio, but also <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you\u2019ll achieve your goals for the site. Even more importantly, you\u2019ll be able to reference your answers throughout the design process to help inform your decisions \u2014 and to review your site after launch to make sure it\u2019s meeting your goals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Mistake 2: Lacking a custom, responsive design<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you know what your site\u2019s goal is, inside and out, you can define how you\u2019ll get people to help you fulfill that goal. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That will mean something different for each individual purpose, but in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cases, it\u2019ll mean defining a path to the fulfilment of that goal, be it filling out a contact form or just checking out your blog. And that will have a profound impact on your design.<\/span><br \/>\nIf you\u2019re looking to build your brand via your in-depth blog posts, maybe your front page is just a blog index, with projects an afterthought, and social sharing options super-prominent.<br \/>\nLooking to attract clients? Maybe you make a \u201cGet in touch\u201d CTA visible on each and every page, and point it to a form that features testimonials on one side and tailored form fields on the other.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get where I\u2019m going here: whatever your purpose, <\/span><b>your portfolio website\u2019s design shouldn\u2019t be some generic template<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><br \/>\nYour portfolio should be tailor-made to communicate your purpose and drive people to act on that purpose, not matter what device they\u2019re using.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(And if you\u2019re looking for a great way to custom-build your portfolio, there\u2019s no better option than <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webflow<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But hey, I may be biased.)<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Mistake 3: Relying on imagery alone<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t expect luscious screenshots to do the job for you\u2014these days, a beautiful website just isn\u2019t enough. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, you\u2019re competing against <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hordes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of other talented visual designers. Some of whom are almost certainly better than you, at least on the visual side of things. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s where your non-visual content can really help set you apart. So instead of just posting a series of screenshots cleverly placed on a variety of devices, put some meat on your projects\u2019 bones with case studies. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A standard structure for a case study includes: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Problem<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Solution<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Result<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Clearly define the problem you were tasked with solving and how you solved the problem. In some cases, documenting process will matter a great deal (typically, more salient for those seeking in-house work), while for others it will matter less (freelancers).<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But be sure to always include the challenge, solution, and key results. This will allow you to add tons of context to your work, and highlight your design thinking. This can be particularly attractive for clients who are facing a similar challenge to the ones capture in your case studies. It\u2019s also helpful to provide the results of your work, as this will show that you\u2019re not <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">just<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> concerned with making beautiful\/usable things, but also delivering results for businesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cContent is king, that\u2019s especially important for portfolios. It\u2019s very easy to shift toward a more design-centered approach. The design isn\u2019t our first goal and that\u2019s what I like about Medium. The platform forces us to center on content.\u201d<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2013Marc Wieland, <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/portfolio-principles\/how-i-built-my-portfolio-on-medium-com-fbb2d50b654#.b9caxsc10\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How I built my portfolio on Medium.com<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Pro tip<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: When naming your case studies, be sure to include a reference to the problem you solved. So instead of \u201cmobile app redesign for company X,\u201d name it \u201cmobile app redesign to increase engagement and conversion.\u201d The greater level of specificity will again attract those looking to overcome a specific challenge you have experience with \u2014 both when they\u2019re on your site, and when they\u2019re googling around. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Mistake 4: Leaving your portfolio to languish<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re hustling to get paid work done <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> land new clients, it\u2019s easy to let your portfolio website go by the wayside. But that\u2019s a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">big<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> mistake. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why? Well, there are a host of reasons, but here are a few of the biggest: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Keeping it real<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: About a year ago now, an event organizer contacted me to see if I\u2019d be interested in speaking on a panel he was putting together. After he managed to track me down, I learned that he\u2019d read on my portfolio that I was working at Esurance \u2014 a fact that hadn\u2019t been true for several years at that point! Would\u2019ve been a shame to miss that opportunity if he hadn\u2019t been able to track me down \/ decided I wasn\u2019t worth it based on one inaccuracy.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b style=\"color: #424242; font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\">Keeping it current<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Regularly adding new work (especially if you use timestamps on posts) will show visitors that you\u2019re actively working and that your design thinking and style are evolving with the times.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b style=\"color: #424242; font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\">Keeping it SEO-friendly<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: There\u2019s solid evidence that <\/span><a style=\"font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\" href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/google-fresh-factor-new\">Google likes fresh content<\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and a new opportunity to crawl your content. Plus, each content update means the potential for more keywords showing up on your site, which means more chances for your site to match your next client\u2019s search.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><b>Mistake 5: Putting no effort into SEO<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While researching this article, I came across a piece in Creative Bloq titled \u201c10 stunning web design portfolios.\u201d And while the websites were, in at least a couple cases, appropriately stunning, their search engine optimization left something to be desired almost across the board. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, there are tons of ways to neglect SEO, but for this example, I\u2019ll list how a couple handled their H1 tags \u2014 one of the most important elements in determining a page\u2019s topic. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\">\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Number one\u2019s H1 tag read \u201cHello.\u201d Not exactly a popular search term.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next? \u201cCode Sketch.\u201d I see.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the next, I couldn\u2019t even find an H1.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The next had an <i style=\"color: #424242; font-family: 'PT Serif', Georgia;\">image<\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> where you\u2019d normally find an H1.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You see where I\u2019m going with this. SEO isn\u2019t the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">only<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> way to help people find your website, and in the world of freelance, it can be a pretty tough way to get found. After all, you\u2019re competing with huge listing sites like Behance, Upwork, etc. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try. Especially when your H1 <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">could<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be something highly targeted and searched, like \u201cfreelance UX designer in the SF Bay Area.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Mistake 6: Oversharing \u2026 the wrong work<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I can\u2019t tell you how often I come across designer portfolios that seem to list <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every single thing<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the designer has ever run through Photoshop or Sketch. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s not what a portfolio is for. Maybe someday, when your genius achieves the worldwide recognition it no doubt deserves, people will labor for years to gather all your design work together in a gorgeous archive. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But until then, remember that your portfolio is supposed to show off your <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work. The stuff you\u2019re proud of. The stuff that helped clients 10x something. The stuff that got an Awwward or a mention in a Smashing Magazine article. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might be helpful to imagine your portfolio as something you\u2019d actually print and carry into your next job interview. Do you actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">want<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to carry your last 50 projects to the office with you \u2014 let alone walk 3 interviewers through every page of it? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can imagine an interviewer\u2019s attention waning, then your website visitors\u2019 attention probably will too. So focus on your best and brightest \u2014 it\u2019s less work for you, and more likely to turn visitors into clients!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ready to refresh your portfolio? <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully, this review of common mistakes has inspired you to take another look at your portfolio.
