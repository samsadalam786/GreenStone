That last point just might be one of the more attractive aspects of this career path, given that the people we\u2019re surrounded by (even virtually!) and the organizations we align ourselves with can have a huge impact on our quality of life.<br \/>\nFinding that personal and professional synergy can happen with a firm down the street, a company across the country, or a startup in Jakarta.<br \/>\nBut if you approach each engagement in the same manner\u2014without regard for local cultural norms\u2014you can come across in a way you\u2019re not intending. What, where, when and how you express yourself as a freelancer can appear rude or insensitive.<br \/>\nHow can you exhibit a more worldly perspective when working with globally-distributed professionals or companies even if you haven&#8217;t left your home state? If you\u2019re keen on working well with folks from hither and yon, read on.<\/p>\n<h3>Do not reveal your geographic or demographic ignorance\u2014or better yet, educate yourself.<\/h3>\n<p>Going to pick on my fellow Americans in particular here, as I\u2019ve been \u2018facepalm\u2019 embarrassed by some comments I\u2019ve heard them say to their (likely very well-traveled) counterparts. For example: Brazilians speak Portuguese, not Spanish; Australia and Austria are on different continents, and . When you start working with people from all over the world, you need to broaden your horizons. So if you\u2019re unable to travel, surf the web to discover where they\u2019re situated, the general climate, the economic state of their country, etc. Note: you don\u2019t necessarily need to reveal this information. It will simply help you to contextualize and further hone your communications style\u2014and make you significantly less likely to look like an idiot.<\/p>\n<h3>Tone down the slang by a few magnitudes.<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m not even talking about the obvious stuff only a local or a native speaker would know, or the things you might hear in Hollywood films. Clearly, you wouldn\u2019t tell a business contact from Uzbekistan that a new product design was \u2018off the chain.\u2019 But even a seemingly benign, common phrase like \u2018how\u2019s it going?\u2019 can be misheard or misunderstood. Remember: text-based communication is often easier for non-native speakers of any language, and when it comes to conversations, comprehension while listening is a whole heck of a lot easier than attempting to express oneself with the spoken word. (I know this from experience.) So gauge your clients\u2019 communication preferences and adapt to them.<\/p>\n<h3>Learn to say a few key phrases in their language correctly&#8211;and greet them first.<\/h3>\n<p>This gesture is almost always met with immediate warmth and appreciation, even if you\u2019re not a linguist. That said, it really shouldn&#8217;t be done in a half-assed way. First, seek out online references with native speakers offering tutorials on some basic greetings and exchanges. If you have a fluent friend who can help, even better! Then, try as best as you can to replicate a native accent rather than converting the sounds to yours; remember to put the emphasis on the right syllable. Note: in some cultures, you\u2019ll want to get right down to business, while in others, building rapport through small talk is key. (Check out <a href=\"https:\/\/www.inc.com\/jessica-stillman\/the-quick-and-dirty-guide-to-small-talk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this post by Inc<\/a>\u00a0on international small talk with some solid pointers.) Take this into account, and you\u2019ll be on to making a great first impression.<\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t judge someone\u2019s role based on job title alone.<\/h3>\n<p>Keep in mind that organizational hierarchies and decision-making processes vary widely across cultures, and are influenced by institutional traditions, market type, legal systems and demographics. In some countries, for instance, a \u2018specialist\u2019 would be equivalent to what might be called a manager in other places. In other, more egalitarian companies, titles may take on little meaning at all. Be attuned to the layout of any teams you\u2019re working with, along with the nature and tone of their interactions (as much as you\u2019re exposed to them). Some may surprise you by coming to a decision by consensus, while others may emphasize structure, procedure and punctuality over flexibility and adaptability.<\/p>\n<h3>Respectfully acknowledge others\u2019 national and religious holidays.<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason you don\u2019t wish someone a \u2018happy\u2019 Yom Kippur, ANZAC Day or Bastille Day. (If you don\u2019t know it, you should look those up.) So if your colleagues or clients are vocal about observing certain holidays, find out what some appropriate greetings might be. Adding a well-timed \u2018Eid Mubarak!\u2019 or \u2018Frohe Weihnachten!\u2019 to a one-on-one chat or an email thread will help them to feel both appreciated and more comfortable around you in general. This isn\u2019t about scoring bonus points or looking like a know-it-all; it\u2019s about creating an atmosphere of mutual respect.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8230;but avoid discussing and\/or debating about religion or politics.<\/h3>\n<p>Like the old advice that goes for any and all family gatherings, these two hot-button topics also have no place in business interactions. Not a big fan of Vladimir Putin? Keep it to yourself when meeting with that St. Petersburg-based crew. Curious about daily routines in Mormon-majority Utah? Save your questions for Quora. Unless a rare opportunity reveals itself (e.g., you\u2019ve built up a certain rapport and openness with a client), you shouldn\u2019t tread down this path uninvited. Note: even if you ARE invited to share your opinion on a potentially divisive topic, carefully consider how doing so could impact your relationship.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Have tips of your own to share?
