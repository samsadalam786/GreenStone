Why go through the process of setting up in a temporary office when you could just as easily work from home? The thing is, though, that it\u2019s not always easy. Even if we can manufacture complete and utter silence on our couch, we\u2019re still cutting our productivity short\u2014 we actually tend work better with some background noise. Also, working from home can keep you from realizing your true potential. Unless we have a dedicated home office, we tend to associate home with relaxation. It\u2019s difficult to bang out your next project on the same couch upon which you eat Pad Thai and watch <em>Stranger Things<\/em> like take-out royalty. Heading to a local cafe is an obvious option, but \u201cobvious\u201d doesn\u2019t always translate to \u201cbest\u201d. It can be cramped or noisy, and the wifi can be terrible. At the end of the day, your local coffee joint is meant to be a caffeination station and a meeting spot for awkward dates.<br \/>\nSometimes, you need to work somewhere designed for actually being productive. And that\u2019s what coworking spaces are for. If you\u2019re in New York City, we\u2019ve already got you covered; today we\u2019ve decided to show Bean Town some love.<\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/workbar.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workbar<\/a><\/h2>\n<p>Why not lead off with the city\u2019s original coworking space? Workbar has been around since 2009 and set an example for many of the other spaces around the country. Workbar has central hubs in Boston, Cambridge, Somerville, and Arlington. Each is designed to give you collaboration when you want it and concentration when you need it. Workbar also manages several \u201cspokes\u201d locations. Via a first-of-its-kind <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/home\/20160404005182\/en\/Staples-Workbar-Offer-Coworking-Spaces-Retail-Locations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">collaboration<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/staples-finds-new-use-for-its-stores-office-space-1459742565\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Staples<\/a>, Workbar has brought the phenomenon of coworking from the city to the \u2018burbs. If Boston is too much of a schlep, you can make your work home in Brighton, Norwood, or Danvers. Dozens of member perks and discounts, as well as collaborations with local business, keep the Workbar community tight and actually excited for Mondays.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2>Coalition<\/h2>\n<p>The collection of workers in this Downtown Crossing coworking space live up to the Coalition name.
