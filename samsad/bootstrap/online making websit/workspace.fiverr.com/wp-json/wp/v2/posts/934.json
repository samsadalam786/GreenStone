However, while most of our graduates go on to be developers at companies ranging from budding startups to huge enterprise businesses, Mitch and Vincent decided to take a different path. They both struck out on their own, taking on the gig economy as freelancers\u2014though their businesses and offerings are quite different. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent, working under the name <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/alfieri.io\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VSA Productions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is a freelance full stack web developer, building web applications and websites for clients. His current project? Creating an online platform for a decades-old insurance business. While the business formerly revolved around phone and email interactions, Vincent\u2019s work will allow employees and clients to communicate seamlessly over the platform he\u2019s building. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, after finishing our program, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/mitchboyer.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitch<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> decided to pivot to other passions\u2014illustration, photography, and directing. Mitch works with clients like New York Public Radio, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday Night Live<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and Lady Gaga. He has also had a viral moment online for pictures he put out of his pet dachshund, Vivian\u2014<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">at the enormous size she imagines herself<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. He\u2019s currently writing a children\u2019s book, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.kickstarter.com\/projects\/mitchboyer\/vivian-the-dog-moves-to-brooklyn\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vivian the Dog Moves To Brooklyn<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, based on those photos. While these pursuits aren\u2019t exactly web development, Mitch credits learning how to code with teaching him valuable skills for his freelancing work. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We spoke to Mitch and Vincent to get their tips on building your freelancing business\u2014and how learning to code can help, whether or not you\u2019re a web developer. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Communicate\u2014Get on the Same Page as the Client<\/b><\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your clients know their business and they likely know what they want from you as a freelancer\u2014but chances are they don\u2019t know the technical terminology to communicate their ideas to you. It\u2019s important to spend the time to learn a client\u2019s business and how they work so you can get on the same page. Vincent stresses that you need to \u201cknow the underlying business you\u2019re trying to serve. This not only allows you to communicate better; you\u2019ll also bring more value when building a product than you would if you were winging it. Don\u2019t spend hours and hours on something only to find out later the client doesn\u2019t like it because it doesn\u2019t relate to their business.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitch seconds the notion that when you\u2019re on the same page as the client, everything is much easier. One way to ensure this? \u201cPut out distinctive work,\u201d Mitch recommends. \u201cThe more <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> your work is, the better clients you\u2019ll attract.\u201d In Mitch\u2019s case, Radiolab and New York Public Radio hired him based on a\u00a0personal project he had done. \u201cWe were on the same page right away. Things went smoothly.\u201d Upfront communication can also let you know when there might not be a good fit with a client\u2014and when it may be the right time to turn down a job. \u00a0\u201cWhen people say \u2018I like what you do, but I want to change X, Y, Z,\u2019 it\u2019s more difficult,\u201d Mitch says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get on the same page, I\u2019ll often say I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a good fit and recommend a friend for the job.\u201d You can be sure your clients are vetting you; don\u2019t be afraid to vet them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Leverage Your Community<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Mitch, a huge benefit of attending a coding bootcamp was the access he gained to a passionate, creative community. Noting that the vast majority of his cohort have kept in touch since finishing the program, Mitch says that \u201canytime anyone is looking for a job, they\u2019re able to ask the community. I\u2019ve found jobs through that network. People from my class have hired me for artwork and photoshoots or have referred me to their companies.\u201d Mitch credits his initial success as a freelancer to leveraging these personal connections. \u201cI was intimidated when I first went freelance,\u201d he says. \u201cI tried to reach out to companies I didn\u2019t know. But I\u2019ve found the most success when I use my existing network to find clients.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent points out that impressing just one client in your network can snowball into more opportunities. \u201cMy client is doing a side-startup and he plans to bring me in to help,\u201d he says. \u201cPick your battles. Rather than going after a huge number of clients, I chose to pour all my time and energy into this one project\u2014but if I nail it, it\u2019ll lead to more opportunities.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Be Patient<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Mitch first decided to go freelance, he was in talks with a company for a large illustration job. \u201cIt was big enough to cover my costs for three months, which was huge,\u201d he says. Unfortunately, Mitch pulled the trigger and left his previous full-time job before locking down the contract for the gig. \u201cI wasn\u2019t patient enough to cross my T\u2019s and dot my I\u2019s. Luckily, I had already started the hustle, but those first few months were stressful because I wasn\u2019t patient.\u201d He regrets not taking more time to build up his networking before jumping in, however&#8230; <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>When You Don\u2019t Have Work,<\/b><b><i>\u00a0Hire Yourself as a Client<\/i><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, because Mitch wasn\u2019t working on that huge lost job, he had lots of free time. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started developing the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vivian The Dog<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> book,\u201d Mitch says. \u201cWith my free time, I started working on that project, and ironically that project is something that could potentially become full-time for me.\u201d So when you don\u2019t have work,<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> hire yourself as a client<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and build your side projects. \u201cIt\u2019s done so much for me,\u201d Mitch says. \u201cNow I get contacted by fans of the Vivian photos for similar work. It\u2019s opened up doors I never even knew existed.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>&lt;style=&#8221;text-align: left;&#8221;&gt;<b>Commit to Lifelong Learning.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t be afraid to learn new things. Vincent is currently learning other coding languages like CSS in order to build more attractive websites for his clients. He notes, \u201cYou can build an amazing app, but if it looks like crap, no one will use it.\u201d He\u2019s also open with his client that he\u2019s continuing to learn\u2014and the client appreciates it. \u201cHe knows I might have moments of hitting my head against the wall trying to figure out something new, but he sees I\u2019m committed to getting it. He understands that this process is going to help me make the product better.\u201d <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mitch completely agrees. And that\u2019s one reason he decided to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">stop<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pursuing programming. He notes that his web developer roommates are constantly learning. \u201cThey seem to always be at conferences for programming. They come home from work and they keep programming at home!\u201d Mitch didn\u2019t feel that level of passion for programming, but he <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">did<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have that it in other areas: storytelling, filmmaking, photography. \u201cThat\u2019s why I shifted to where I am now. If you want to be the best at what you do, you have to commit to a life of learning. It\u2019s just what you have to do, whether you\u2019re a programmer, a photographer, or a beet farmer. If you can\u2019t commit, you can\u2019t compete.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Learn to Code!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vincent has seen firsthand that there are so many old businesses that aren\u2019t leveraging tech\u2014having a tech background that allows you to offer additional services is invaluable. As Vinny says, \u201cCompanies are using archaic technology. Simple things blow their mind. When you talk to someone who\u2019s been doing something the same way for 30 or 40 years and tell them you can do it ten times faster and show them the value you can provide\u2026 they think you\u2019re a wizard.\u201d <\/span><br \/>\nMitch is an interesting case. \u201cI don\u2019t program very often,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s nice to know how to setup my domain name server; it\u2019s nice to know I can go in and edit the code of my website if I need to.\u201d But the biggest advantage of learning to code for Mitch was gaining confidence to pursue new things. \u201cBefore programming, I didn\u2019t think I was good at math; I didn\u2019t think I was good at logical thinking. When you learn how to program, you discipline your mind. I became a much more analytical thinker going to Flatiron School.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what can other freelance artists who <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want to be developers gain from a programming education? \u201cYou learn how to look at a problem from a few different angles, take it apart, and work your way through it\u2014you\u2019re kind of debugging it,\u201d Mitch says. \u201cI almost have my own kind of test driven development for everything I do now. Whether I\u2019m working on a new film script or planning a tough design, I\u2019m testing my solutions along the way.\u201d \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you want to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.ly\/H042xTq0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">start a career as a web developer<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or you\u2019re just hoping to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.ly\/H042xTG0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">skill up to better serve your clients<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, programming abilities can be vital. Curious if it\u2019s the right move for you? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hubs.ly\/H042xVk0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can start learning how to code for free with Flatiron School right here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Mitch Boyer and Vincent Alfieri both attended Flatiron School, a coding bootcamp with courses in New York City and online, to learn web development.
