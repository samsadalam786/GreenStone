A few days pass. No response from your usually hyper-connected client. You email them again. Silence.<br \/>\nLooks like you\u2019ve been ghosted. Unfortunately, disappearing clients aren\u2019t just a sideshow attraction and being owed money for work you\u2019ve signed, sealed, and delivered isn\u2019t exactly a rare occurrence for solopreneurs and freelancers. In fact, the Freelancers Union has found that more than 70 percent of clients have been stiffed.<br \/>\nLast year the advocacy group created a movement in New York City, one of the top freelance hubs in the world, to formally push for legislation designed to protect freelancers right. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/dca\/about\/freelance-isnt-free-act.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Isn&#8217;t Free Act<\/a> was signed into law in Fall 2016, and goes into effect in just a few days, on <a href=\"https:\/\/www1.nyc.gov\/site\/dca\/about\/freelance-isnt-free-act.page\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">May 15<\/a>.<br \/>\nNot sure where to start after your client\u2019s gone MIA? We spoke with lawyer\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/heratylaw.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Quinn Heraty<\/a>, a specialist in so-called &#8220;ghosting&#8221; clients to gather some concise, actionable tips for freelancers.<\/p>\n<h3>Make your terms crystal clear<\/h3>\n<p>You know all that fine print you scroll past on your way to the \u201cagree\u201d button at the bottom of a terms and conditions page? Well, when you\u2019re crafting your own terms and conditions, you have to be a bit more thorough. \u201cHave a written agreement and discuss the terms of the agreement so both parties know what their rights and obligations are,\u201d says Heraty.<br \/>\nWhen you&#8217;re drafting your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelance contract<\/a>,\u00a0be sure to take note of their style and demeanor. \u201cIf someone is flaky or dismissive, then those are red flags as far as how they will conduct business with you,\u201d he says. Another way to protect yourself is to include their address and phone number in the contract so you can easily follow up on the phone or bring them to Small Claims Court.<br \/>\nTerms and conditions aren\u2019t just for the contract\u2014you can include them on your invoices as well\u00a0(<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoice-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s free invoice templates can help with that!<\/a>). Specify how you&#8217;re owed and when, as well as how you expect to be paid, and whether you\u2019ll charge late fees. Heraty also advises to be as accommodating as possible when it comes to payment. If they use an online payment service, he advises to create an account there,\u00a0even if you\u2019d rather use a different method.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fclient-ghosted-now%2F&#038;text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20being%20paid%20by%20your%20client%2C%20try%20to%20be%20as%20accommodating%20as%20possible.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">When it comes to being paid by your client, try to be as accommodating as possible. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fclient-ghosted-now%2F&#038;text=When%20it%20comes%20to%20being%20paid%20by%20your%20client%2C%20try%20to%20be%20as%20accommodating%20as%20possible.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nRemember, the easier you make it for your client to pay you, the more likely you are to get paid in a timely manner.<br \/>\nIf you just read through those tips and thought to yourself, \u201cBut I did all that!\u201d don\u2019t fret. Here are three steps to take when your client has decided to skip out on their end of the bargain.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Play nice<\/h3>\n<p>It might take you an hour to craft a carefully worded email, but if that\u2019s what it takes to fight off the desire to write in all caps, exclamation points and swears, then take all the time you need. \u201cLet [the client]\u00a0know that you want to resolve things with them amicably,\u201d says Heraty, even if that means working out a payment plan in the off chance that they don\u2019t have enough money to pay all at once. She also warns against \u201cshaming or haranguing your client,\u201d as in most cases you&#8217;ll want to salvage the relationship for future projects.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Give a final warning<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve sent several follow up emails (and\/or made calls) and still haven\u2019t heard back, then you might consider bringing in a lawyer, depending on the size of the project. Legal fees can add up, so a good first step is to send your client an email notifying them of your decision in order to give them one more opportunity to settle everything simply. Sometimes, knowing that you\u2019re not joking around is all it takes for a vanished client to suddenly appear at your doorstep with money in hand. And if you get permission from your lawyer, you can even &#8216;cc&#8217; them in the email for added gravitas.<br \/>\nPro-tip: Want to\u00a0<em>really<\/em> get their attention? Physical letters cut through the clutter in an age where 99% of communications occur on digital channels. Fiverr Workspace recently released a new tool, called <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Williams&amp;Harricks<\/a>, which allows you to send a demand letter to your client of varying degrees of sternness, for just $3. If you&#8217;re an Fiverr Workspace user, you can send these directly from the app.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fclient-ghosted-now%2F&#038;text=Stiffed%20by%20a%20client%3F%20Bring%20in%20Williams%26Harricks%20to%20send%20them%20a%20demand%20letter%20on%20your%20behalf.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stiffed by a client?

Take them to court (if it\u2019s worth it)<\/h3>\n<p>Technically, you can file a case against your client through your local Small Claims Court, but depending on how much they owe you, it might not be worth your time and the additional money you\u2019ll have to cough up for fees. If you\u2019re not sure whether Small Claims is the way to go, Peter Hilton\u2019s article\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2014\/04\/01\/what-all-freelancers-should-know-about-small-claims-court\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">via the Freelancers Union<\/a>\u00a0is a good starting point.<br \/>\nThe truth is, even after all of this, you might still get stiffed, which is why it\u2019s crucial that you never start a project without a signed contract that lays down both of your obligations when it comes to payment. It&#8217;s simply the easiest way to protect yourself from Day 1.<br \/>\nConfused about how to write a contract? <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace has your back<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Did your client vanish in the night and take your money with them?
