Plus, there are many ways to carry out those options with different platforms designed to help your money grow. On the other hand, before you start investing, you should definitely make sure you have some money to fall back on in the case of an emergency (like a rainy day fund).\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">So, whether you&#8217;re all backed up with funds or you\u2019re looking for ways to expand the savings you have, here are some of the best ways for you to invest a cool $5,000:<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">1. Invest with Robo-advisors<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">With investing, it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed, but fortunately, you have the internet at your disposal and a bunch of great platforms to help you out.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">For example,\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/partners.sofi.com\/nw-invest-generic\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Sofi Automated Investing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">\u00a0is completely free and has no minimum requirement, so you could invest as little as $1 if you wanted. Sofi will also build a stock portfolio for you and do the investing automatically, which is pretty cool for a free platform.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Another option for the Robo-investing route is\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.betterment.com\/investing\/?clickid=28WQX7W47xyOU-1wUx0Mo3cgUki3ajyoKX3hRE0&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=170911&amp;offer_campaign_id=1c8d4070-1003-4bb0-a4c5-35b3a3a9cf51&amp;dclid=CjkKEQjwuJz3BRDB2a3ghJupouwBEiQAjkuyIqbmWmF3UfD3FzUHbx89HmzyV38rru4woBlghtx-CAHw_wcB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Betterment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">This platform isn&#8217;t free, but it comes with some eye-opening benefits. Of course, a portfolio will be automatically created for you to fit your specific goals, but you can also create as many portfolios as you want. On top of that, you can see all of your portfolios in one place on the Betterment app or website. Betterment will do everything possible to act in your best interests on each portfolio as well. So, the small management fee is definitely worth it.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">One more Robo-advisor to consider is\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blooom.com\/affiliates\/5\/?irgwc=1&amp;utm_source=Nerdwallet%2C%20Inc&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=170911&amp;clickid=28WQX7W47xyOU-1wUx0Mo3cgUki3an3MKX3hRE0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: underline;vertical-align: baseline\">Blooom<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Blooom is specifically designed to help those when the stock market isn&#8217;t up to par. They do this by using trends and sticking to the three O&#8217;s of investing during troubling times: Own, Opt, and Odds.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">With logic and stats, Blooom gives you an extra boost towards your retirement, while keeping your $5,000 investment intact during tough economic times.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">2. Invest In yourself<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Instead of relying on the free market to make you money, why not use that $5,000 for your own personal gain?\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">As a freelancer, you\u2019re probably going to have time to do and try new things at home. For instance, you could pay for an online class that teaches a new skill that could be beneficial to you. As an example, if you&#8217;re a videographer, why not try to learn how to add cool special effects to some of your past projects? You can also<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/learn.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">\u00a0learn from Fiverr\u00a0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">by investing some money on their site. They have plenty of cool and exclusive tutorials, inspiring teachers, and a ton of great crash courses that will suit your interests.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Or once the COVID pandemic is all said and done, maybe you\u2019ll have an interest in going back to school for another degree. The $5,000 will surely help pay for that. Another option could be starting a small business with your nest egg, which could potentially gain you a lot more money than you would make investing in stocks or anything like that.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Basically, your first $5,000 doesn\u2019t have to go into something you can&#8217;t control<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span>it may be better to just use it on yourself for your own personal growth, which is never a bad investment. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">3. Opening an IRA<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Retirement is something that everyone should be able to look forward to, and there\u2019s no better way to prepare for a milestone like that than with an IRA.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">An IRA is an account you can use that helps you save for retirement. Luckily, setting one of these up is fairly simple. Nerdwallet has an easy set of steps you can follow that will help you\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/investing\/how-and-where-to-open-an-ira\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: underline;vertical-align: baseline\">set up your IRA<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">On top of helping your retirement, traditional IRA\u2019s also deduct taxes. However, that\u2019s only if your employers don\u2019t give out a qualified retirement plan. If so, then you need to make below a certain amount of money to receive tax deductions. But on the bright side, another benefit of traditional IRA\u2019s is that it is protected from bankruptcy.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">You can\u2019t go wrong with an IRA. And remember, everyone is able to participate, no matter how much they make!<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">4. Bonds<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Bonds are different from any other kind of investment since it\u2019s actually you lending money over, with an interest rate attached, to a service that is in debt. Once they get back into a stable shape, they pay you back the money you invested along with the money made from the interest.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Compared to stock investments, bonds are considered to be a more reliable and safer investment since the stock market can change in all directions frequently. However, for a government service you invested in, it is most likely going to be able to pay you back along with the extra cash.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">How do you start to invest in bonds? Well, The Motley Fool\u2019s<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.fool.com\/investing\/how-to-invest\/bonds\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: underline;vertical-align: baseline\">\u00a0review on bonds<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">\u00a0tells you how!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Overall, Bonds are a safe option for investments but often end with less profit than the other investing strategies.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">5. Exchange Trade Funds (ETFs)<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">ETFs, just like stocks, require you to buy and share part of a company or service, only this time, you don&#8217;t technically own part of the company or service.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">This is because you&#8217;re actually purchasing from an index fund that is an imitation of the product or service\u2019s progress in the market. Fund providers make this portfolio to gauge how their service is doing, but they also sell shares to new investors like you, within this portfolio.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">So where does the money come from? Well, you trade or exchange the ETF with other buyers and sellers during the day and that&#8217;s how you make a profit.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Keep in mind that you aren&#8217;t limited to one type of ETF. In fact, there are actually a bunch of different types of ETFs. There are types you\u2019ve already covered like Bond and Stock ETFs, but also more complex and diverse ones like Sector and Commodity ETFs that can sometimes be pretty risky.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Nerdwallet gives a wonderful\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"text-decoration: none\" href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/investing\/what-is-an-etf#:~:text=ETF%20%3D%20Exchange%2Dtraded%20fund&amp;text=An%20ETF%20works%20like%20this,underlying%20assets%20in%20the%20fund.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: underline;vertical-align: baseline\">review of ETFs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">\u00a0and how to purchase them as well.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Overall, ETFs are a generally safe and risk-free option for new investors that want to get into the game.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: bold;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">Check Out And.Co<\/span><\/h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">While diving into the investing world may be scary, AND.CO is here to help!\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline\">With plenty of services and tips to help you take control of your financial future, you&#8217;ll have all the time you&#8217;ll need to earn money and start investing in a plan that works for you.
