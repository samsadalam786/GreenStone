Pitching is as much the bread and butter of a freelance writing practice as the actual writing because without the pitching, there\u2019s no writing.<br \/>\nAt the same time, for every freelancer pitching his or her little heart out, there\u2019s an editor on the receiving end, holding the keys to the kingdom. Just as you may be sending out pitch after pitch, they\u2019re getting them in their ever-clogged up inbox. To break through the noise, freelance writers need to treat each pitch like the important piece of writing that it is. If you don\u2019t convince the editor to want to hear more, why would your finished piece convince their readers of anything?<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20writers%20need%20to%20treat%20each%20pitch%20like%20the%20important%20piece%20of%20writing%20that%20it%20is.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance writers need to treat each pitch like the important piece of writing that it is. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20writers%20need%20to%20treat%20each%20pitch%20like%20the%20important%20piece%20of%20writing%20that%20it%20is.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nCommit to your pitch with the following tips from top editors at a variety of outlets, and see what they have to say about what makes a pitch stick. And when we say stick, that may mean it becomes a story, or at the very least, establishes your credibility and your positioning in their inbox.<\/p>\n<h3>DO: Practice professional email etiquette.<\/h3>\n<p>As creatives, writers may shun the \u201crules\u201d of corporate life, but email communication at the outset of your relationship with an editor can and should be polished and professional without sounding stiff or formal. In fact, a lack of decorum is often the first thing that will have an editor passing on a pitch.<br \/>\nCharlotte Cowles, editorial director of <a href=\"https:\/\/mmlafleur.com\/mdash\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">M.M. LeFleur<\/a> and former senior features editor at Harper\u2019s Bazaar says, \u201cA clean, polite, warm, and semi-formal opener. This is your first chance to show that you&#8217;re capable and professional, and also able to write in a voice that&#8217;s appropriate for our website.\u201d Additionally, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coolhunting.com\/author\/katie-alice-olsen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Katie Olsen<\/a>, Managing Editor of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.coolhunting.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cool Hunting<\/a> says her biggest pet peeve when receiving pitches is misinformation. \u201cMake sure you get names right\u2014we oftentimes get emails with the wrong publication or editor\u2019s name. Proofreading goes a long way.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>DON\u2019T: Make them do the work.<\/h3>\n<p>Not only does it come off as entitled when someone expects the editor to give the writer information they could and should have found on their own, but it doesn\u2019t bode well for the pitcher\u2019s reporting skills or savvy.<br \/>\nFor Cowles, \u201cIt\u2019s an instant \u2018nope\u2019 when an email is too breezy, casual, and unstructured. \u2018Hey, just wondering if you guys are accepting any pitches? Thanks!\u2019 does not cut it.\u201d<br \/>\nChris Rovzar, Luxury Editor at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bloomberg<\/a> and former digital editor of Vanity Fair says his pet peeve is \u201cwhen a new writer will approach me and say, &#8220;What kind of stories are you looking for? Have anything you need to assign?&#8221; It&#8217;s not my job to think of story ideas for writers I don&#8217;t know. If I have an idea, I will give it to a writer I know and trust. It&#8217;s a new contributor&#8217;s job to look through our site.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>DO: Google, for goodness\u2019 sake.<\/h3>\n<p>You may have the greatest idea ever, but so might lots of other writers and publications. The tools to check are right at your fingertips and again, your failure to take this simple first step will set the tone for how you might report, so be thorough right off the bat. The same goes for the outlet itself: search, search, search. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good look to suggest an article on a topic that&#8217;s way out of a publication&#8217;s wheelhouse, or something that they have already covered,\u201d says Olsen.<br \/>\nAnd for Rovzar, a lack of thoroughness will immediately stop him from reading on. \u201cI will stop reading a pitch if it shows me that the writer is not familiar with my outlet or what it covers. Do your research. I need to know in detail where this person, story, or issue has been covered before. If I find that it&#8217;s been covered in a close rival publication after I&#8217;ve assigned it, not only will I cancel the assignment, but I will remember that this is a writer who doesn&#8217;t do his homework.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>DO: Include just enough information.<\/h3>\n<p>Your pitch should give editors a taste of what the story might entail, with the right dose of politeness, relevancy and clarity\u2014and leave them wanting more. \u201cBe confident, but not too shtick-y. State your background and qualifications, and why you want to write for us. Then sketch out a few topics\u2014no need to go super in-depth in the first email\u2014and ask if they&#8217;re of interest,\u201d states Cowles.<br \/>\nRovzar agrees in needing a loose outline of the piece straight off the bat. \u201cFor me to assign a story I need to know roughly what the writer will talk about in the piece, and what sources he or she will consult. (If it&#8217;s a list, I&#8217;ll need some examples to make sure they will fit right. If there are examples of a trend, I need to know that there are enough solid ones to go on.)\u201d<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=Your%20pitch%20should%20give%20editors%20a%20taste%20of%20what%20the%20story%20might%20entail%E2%80%94and%20leave%20them%20wanting%20more.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Your pitch should give editors a taste of what the story might entail\u2014and leave them wanting more. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=Your%20pitch%20should%20give%20editors%20a%20taste%20of%20what%20the%20story%20might%20entail%E2%80%94and%20leave%20them%20wanting%20more.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>DO: Have a point of view.<\/h3>\n<p>Remember, the rules are different for new freelancers versus in-house writers or those who already have a regular relationship with the editor. New writers trying to get in on the game must show how they think, and not just that they\u2019d be able to execute an assignment.<br \/>\nFor Cowles, \u201cWriters should be aware of the content we already create in-house: We aren&#8217;t going to hire a freelancer to write a piece about \u20185 Great Interview Outfits,\u2019 because we already know what those are (we make them!). Think about what you can add to the conversation, not mimic it.\u201d She continues, \u201cIf any of the suggested topics sound intriguing, I&#8217;ll usually write back and ask if you can explain more about the angle you&#8217;d take. This is when you get to show that you&#8217;re a nuanced and original thinker, and aware of the current discussions surrounding the subject in question. For example, the world probably doesn&#8217;t need another story about returning to work after maternity leave\u2014but if you want to write an essay about getting fired right after coming back from maternity leave, then that&#8217;s more interesting.\u201d<br \/>\nRovzar agrees on keeping things fresh. \u201cFor me to keep reading, a pitch must hit me with a surprising fact or anecdote right at the get-go. And it must have a news peg\u2014it needs to have an urgent reason that we would tell a story now. I can&#8217;t run a piece that&#8217;s been in a million places already or is known to our readers, but if there is a new angle to something that&#8217;s been around a while, I&#8217;ll consider it.\u201d<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=New%20writers%20trying%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20game%20must%20show%20how%20they%20think.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New writers trying to get in on the game must show how they think. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Feditors-reveal-what-they-love-what-they-loathe-in-pitches%2F&#038;text=New%20writers%20trying%20to%20get%20in%20on%20the%20game%20must%20show%20how%20they%20think.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>DON\u2019T: be discouraged right away.<\/h3>\n<p>If you have followed all the right advice and still haven\u2019t gotten a response, try again but be patient. Or, if it\u2019s not a fit, the quality of your pitch may still keep you in the Editor\u2019s mind and get you a chance to go again. \u201cIf the writer appears capable and has good clips that demonstrate a smart, funny, and appealing voice, then I&#8217;ll write back with questions or suggestions. Ideas are rarely perfect at first, and often take some massaging before they coalesce, \u201d says Cowles. And for Rovzar, \u201cIf a pitch is well-written, shows a sense that the writer understands what *kind* of story we would do, and includes a news peg and examples of coverage elsewhere, I will definitely encourage that writer to send me other ideas.\u201d<br \/>\nBut, a word of warning from Olsen: \u201cDon\u2019t email\/call to follow-up too soon. Even though you\u2019re understandably eager, most editors have to wade through hundreds of emails every day, and yours unfortunately might not be the most timely.
