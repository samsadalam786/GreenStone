You deserve one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><a href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/partner\/moleskine\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Evernote) Moleskine<\/span><\/a><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ah, the Moleskine. If it were good enough for Oscar Wilde, Matisse, and Hemingway, then why shouldn\u2019t it be good enough for you? Impress your friends by showing them that, yes, you still know how to write things down. As a freelancing individual, inspiration can strike at any time, and waiting to get in front of a computer to fully express your ideas could be too long. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this is the twenty-first century, so, of course, there\u2019s a digital upgrade available. Consider shelling out for an Evernote Moleskine\u2014it syncs up with the popular Evernote app and digitizes each stroke of your pen. You\u2019ll get a version saved to your laptop, tablet, and\/or phone, so you can turn your downtime brainstorming into a springboard of productivity wherever you are.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pencil\/Pen Roll<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve got a notebook, you\u2019re going to need a writing implement. Turn an otherwise mundane task into a fancy flourish by keeping your favorite pens and pencils in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Rustic-Genuine-Leather-Pencil-Roll\/dp\/B00Q7B69AG\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leather roll<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will make classic vibes emanate outward from your very being. As an added bonus, keeping those writing sticks wrapped in luxury will suddenly cause you to care more about your choice of pen or pencil. Before you know it, you\u2019ll be dying to show off your sleek pens and perfect (or rather, unique-at-best) penmanship at every opportunity. People will definitely take a mental note, but they won\u2019t be anywhere near as good as your written ones.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business Card Case<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some will argue that business cards are on the way out. What\u2019s wrong with asking to put your contact info into a potential client\u2019s phone? Nothing really, but a business card\u2014 even for a freelancer\u2014 can leave a lasting impression. Your new contact will think of your card as a tangible reminder to give you a call and put you on some cool projects. The only possible way to make a <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">more<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lasting impression is to keep your cards in a sweet, minimalist, business card case. You\u2019ll go from \u201ccharming charming creative I met yesterday\u201d to \u201ccharming creative who carries their name in style and oh god, I\u2019m giving them work <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right now.<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Das Mechanical Keyboard<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing stuff down is great. But unless you\u2019re a time-traveling freelancer from the days when you could get a swank <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mad-men-real-estate-investment-2015-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upper East Side pad for under $60,000<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/mad-men-real-estate-investment-2015-4\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">have a fully furnished house party every Saturday night<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just because you felt like it, you\u2019re going to be using a computer from time to time (read: probably every day). So why not upgrade your typing game with a Das Mechanical Keyboard? You\u2019ll become a faster and more accurate typist, your mechanical keyboard will outlast whatever flimsy typing surface that came with your computer, and you\u2019ll get that throwback \u201cclickitey-clack\u201d sound so you bang out projects while sounding like a boss. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headphones<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a freelancer, you\u2019re already equipped with a few playlists to match any new situation that arises. But how are you going to listen to them? You could listen from your computer speakers or standard issue earbuds, but a good set of cans will suck you into the beats and put you in the productivity zone. Here\u2019s a secret: some headphone manufacturers charge exorbitant amounts of money for the name\u2026 and not much else. That\u2019s totally fine if you\u2019re into paying 80% markups in order to have trendy logos on your ears. But as a freelancer, the only brand you need to worry about promoting is your own. So try scooping up a pair of <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Audio-Technica-ATH-M50x-Professional-Monitor-Headphones\/dp\/B00HVLUR86\/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1468877721&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=audio+technica+ath-m50\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AudioTechnica ATH-M50\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Sennheiser-HD-280-Pro-Headphones\/dp\/B000065BPB\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sennheiser HD280\u2019s<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Both are under $150 and feel great on the ears. You\u2019ll never use the throwaway drug-store buds again.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Laptop Bag<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing your computer an amazing bag is like gifting your feet with fresh sneakers. Yeah, any bag will do in a pinch, but splurging on one you really like floods you with all intangible feelings associated with Grade-A Swagger. Go with leather for a splash of sophistication, or a multifunctional one that will carry you from your usual writing haunts to a meeting with a new client. A sturdy bag with deep pockets also means you can carry more than just a computer, too\u2014 load up with notebooks, sketch pads, your favorite design magazine, or that book on you\u2019ve been meaning to read since last year. Seriously, a nicely outfitted bag is the death of boredom. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hourglass<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is a piece of functional desk decorum a tool or an accessory? Who cares? If you have anything left to spend, think about getting an hourglass. Not the kind that comes with Pictionary, but one of those elegant timepieces that can 1) instantly make you look that much more put together, 2) serve as a fancy paperweight, and 3) light a fire under you when some tight deadlines are approaching.
