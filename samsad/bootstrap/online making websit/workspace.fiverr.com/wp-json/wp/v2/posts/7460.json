What you may not realize is just how much you\u2019re invoicing says to your clients about you and your work as a freelancer.&nbsp;<br \/>\nEstablishing <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/maintain-your-success-with-a-freelance-routine\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">a healthy freelance routine<\/span><\/a> should include healthy invoicing habits. In fact, since invoices control how and when you make money, getting in the habit of proper invoicing should be at the forefront of your business strategy.&nbsp;<br \/>\nLike all habits, the best time to make changes to your invoicing procedures is right now. And the first step to improving is identifying problem areas<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span>check out these five habits I\u2019ve identified and see how you stack up.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>1. You Send a Sloppy or Unclear Invoice<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sending an invoice that isn\u2019t succinct and easy-to-understand says that you lack attention to detail\u2014which could be a huge red flag for your client.<br \/>\nNaturally, they may even start to wonder if your sloppiness translates into other areas of your business\u2014maybe even that next project they were thinking about hiring you for.&nbsp;<br \/>\nNot good.<br \/>\nTo address this issue, try using a professional invoicing app like <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">AND.CO<\/span><\/a> to make your invoices more clear and professional.&nbsp;<br \/>\nUsing a pro tool instead of freebies like Google Docs is a leap for some freelancers who are tight on cash. But think about it this way: as a freelancer, your time is the most valuable part of your business.&nbsp;<br \/>\nUsing invoicing software will allow you to spend more of that time on billable work instead of chasing down past-due invoices.&nbsp;<br \/>\nGood invoicing software can also provide better data security, payment tracking, and perks like automatic client followup.&nbsp;<br \/>\nReally, the best benefit of using software to generate a clean, easy-to-read invoice is it gets you back to the creative tasks you love instead of the administrative work you despise.&nbsp;<br \/>\nIf an all-inclusive tool isn\u2019t the best fit for your business, you could also hire someone to design a professional invoice template for you to use over and over again. There are lots of great designers who are ready to help you <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/search\/gigs?query=invoice%20design&amp;source=top-bar&amp;acmpl=1&amp;search_in=everywhere&amp;search-autocomplete-original-term=invoice%20design&amp;search-autocomplete-available=true&amp;search-autocomplete-type=suggest&amp;search-autocomplete-position=1\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">in the Fiverr marketplace<\/span><\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. You Invoice at the Beginning of a Project, Not the End.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Invoicing upon the completion of a project is standard procedure, right? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/290789\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">Not always<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<br \/>\nBrands that sell physical products online usually charge when the item is shipped, not when it\u2019s received. And many suppliers are paid in advance so they can produce the work required.&nbsp;<br \/>\nWhy should your freelance services be different?<br \/>\nSending your invoice when you start a project says that you are confident about the value you bring to your client\u2019s business. As soon as they see your bill hit their inbox, they\u2019ll assume you plan to meet deadlines and present a well-polished project.&nbsp;<br \/>\nWhich, of course, you will.&nbsp;<br \/>\nBilling upfront also puts you on equal footing with your client, so you\u2019re seen as their partner, not a servant or tradesperson. This style of invoicing helps both of you view your interactions as more of a partnership, which leads to more positive client interactions and even higher pay.<br \/>\nBest of all, giving the client a heads up as you start work puts your project in their budget for the current month.&nbsp;<br \/>\nEven if you don\u2019t receive payment until the work is completed, billing ahead helps you <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/past-due-invoice\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">avoid past-due invoices<\/span><\/a><strong>.&nbsp;<\/strong>Many clients appreciate paying upfront so they don\u2019t have to be reminded later when they\u2019ve spent their budgets for the month or quarter.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>3. You Never Follow-up on Overdue Invoices.<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Speaking of past-due invoices, how you handle missed payments says a lot about you as a freelancer.&nbsp;<br \/>\nIf you don\u2019t have consistent procedures in place for tracking and collecting payments, clients may assume you don\u2019t care about getting paid.&nbsp;<br \/>\nWhich means you\u2019ll find your invoices falling to the bottom of the pile every time.&nbsp;<br \/>\nIf you haven\u2019t encountered an overdue invoice in your career, odds are you will. In the UK last year, the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) estimated that freelancers spent an average of 20 days each year <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ipse.co.uk\/ipse-news\/news-listing\/national-work-life-week-freelancers-late-payment.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">chasing late payments<\/span><\/a>.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThat\u2019s something like 160 hours a year you could be spending on other projects, being with family, or taking a much-needed break.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThe problem is, who has time to develop and follow through on detailed invoicing procedures?&nbsp;<br \/>\nHere\u2019s where an <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">invoice tracking software<\/span><\/a> made especially for freelancers can do a lot of heavy lifting. Using automated tools to remind clients about invoices that haven\u2019t been paid not only saves you time, it makes it less awkward trying to chase payments down.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>4. You Itemize Every Little Thing You Did<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sending a complicated invoice with lines for each hour you worked, detailing exactly what happened and when really isn\u2019t necessary.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis all-too-common kind of invoice says that you see yourself as more of a day laborer than a true professional partner.<br \/>\nWhile an invoice absolutely must be clear about what clients are paying for (see habit #1), adding a ton of information does not accomplish that goal.&nbsp;<br \/>\nIn fact, listing too many details might lead your clients to question every line item, scrutinizing the cost and wondering how they can save money next time.&nbsp;<br \/>\nNot what you want.<br \/>\nYou should have already agreed on a total project or hourly cost and the final deliverables back when you <a href=\"https:\/\/betterproposals.io\/blog\/project-proposal\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">sent your proposal<\/span><\/a>. So there is no reason to justify your time, especially if you\u2019re within the original budget.<br \/>\nOn invoices, itemize big-ticket items only. Keep detailed reports saved elsewhere in case of disputes.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>5. You Fail to Include Important Details or Terms<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Once it is agreed to by both parties, an invoice is a legal document. So leaving off key things shows that you don\u2019t understand what it takes to get an invoice paid on time.&nbsp;<br \/>\nHonestly, a less-than-professional invoice says that <em>YOU<\/em> are less-than-professional yourself.<br \/>\nOn the other hand, including things like the original payment terms, details of where to send a check or money transfer, a due date, and other crucial information will ensure you\u2019re paid on time without back-and-forth. This helps you look like the professional you are.<br \/>\nInvesting time into learning <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/how-to-write-an-invoice\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">how to write an invoice<\/span><\/a> that includes all the correct information can pay off big time in the long run.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Paying Attention to Your Invoicing Habits<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As best-selling author <a href=\"https:\/\/jamesclear.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">James Clear<\/span><\/a> put it, \u201cyour life today is essentially the sum of your habits.\u201d&nbsp;<br \/>\nGood habits are good for your business.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThat may be no truer in any other area of your business than when it comes to invoicing.<br \/>\nIf you can get in the habit of sending clear, quality invoices and following up, you\u2019ll appear more professional, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/8-ways-to-save-time-with-your-freelance-business\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline\">save time and effort in your freelance business<\/span><\/a>, and get paid on-time more often.<br \/>\nYou deserve that much from your clients.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>All freelancers deal with invoicing\u2014it\u2019s just part of the business.
