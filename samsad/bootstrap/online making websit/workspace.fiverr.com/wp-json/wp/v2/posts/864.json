But then we turned the question on its head: What are the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fictional places to go to get your projects done?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Elwood City Library &#8212; What a Wonderful Kind of Day to Freelance\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/pbskids.org\/arthur\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Arthur<\/em><\/a>\u2019s crew was insanely smart, even though they\u2019ve been stuck in the third grade for almost twenty years now. They\u2019ve done cool projects on ancient civilizations, have an uncharacteristically fine taste for avant-garde music, and gave us their own version of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Odyssey<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. And none of that would have been possible without the bedrock of elementary intellect and hangout supreme\u2014 the local library. It\u2019s there that this group of kids got Yo-Yo Ma and Joshua Redman to square off in a musical battle. And the summer programs looked <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">so<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> fun. Try to find a more intellectually stimulating library. Just avoid it when they pull a 180 and attempt a musical episode. That could get noisy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>The <\/b><b><i>Nebuchadnezzar &#8212;\u00a0<\/i>Nothing to Distract Freelancers Here<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many an internet user has made a strong case against the \u201cReal World\u201d in the Matrix. Some of the lifestyle parameters of life on earth circa 2199 suck. Burlap sacks aren\u2019t exactly what we\u2019d call a freelancer\u2019s ideal outfit, and a lunch of tinned gruel cannot be a good lunch. But if you do insist on taking the red pill (let\u2019s be honest, it\u2019s because you want nothing more than to be a Jiu Jitsu master isn&#8217;t it?) there are some perks. For one, being on a ship like the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/matrix.wikia.com\/wiki\/Nebuchadnezzar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Neb<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> means that you are surrounded by tech warriors. It\u2019s a custom setup\u2014 the jankiness kind of gives the ship its charm\u2014 so the wifi must be incredible. It also looks like the earth from that time is completely desolate. So while the concept of pastimes may be dead, there is no way you\u2019re getting distracted by anything outdoors. Double the appeal if you\u2019re a freelance coder or web developer. You have so much onboard help, there\u2019s no getting tripped up mid-assignment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Frank Underwood\u2019s Oval Office &#8212; No Goofing Off Allowed<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We get it. <a href=\"https:\/\/house-of-cards.wikia.com\/wiki\/Frank_Underwood\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Frank<\/a>\u2019s a morally bankrupt dude, and we can\u2019t imagine you\u2019d want to spend too much time around him. But consider just how much you could get done when the most intense of presidents is sitting a few feet away from you. Thinking of sneaking onto the front page of Reddit? Frank won\u2019t stand for that sort of procrastination. Whip out your phone to check your Instagram updates? He\u2019ll swat it out of your hand like his name were Mutombo. If he wins reelection, Claire will officially be by his side, and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a pair of humans you don\u2019t want to seen goofing off around. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ron Swanson\u2019s Secret Cabin &#8212; Freelance Sanctuary\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can ensure you aren\u2019t joined by his offbeat coworkers, <a href=\"https:\/\/parksandrecreation.wikia.com\/wiki\/Ron_Swanson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ron<\/a>\u2019s woodside retreat would be awesome for work. You can take the opportunity to get away from it all and collect your thoughts. It\u2019s an ideal hang for ghost-authors and freelance writers of all stripes.
