An additional resource curated for this crowd is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.authenticjobs.com\">Authentic Jobs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 47\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.outsourcely.com\">Outsourcely<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>Outsourcely is the LinkedIn of the remote job market. The platform will ask you to set up a profile and have at least one of your past job positions verified in order to be able to start applying for positions on their site.

Since most jobs here are full-time and on-site, you will need to use keywords like \u201cremote,\u201d \u201cfreelance\u201d or \u201ccontract\u201d to identify the right opportunities.<\/p>\n<h4><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\">LinkedIn<\/a><\/h4>\n<p>LinkedIn is an obvious place to search, and makes it very easy to apply for opportunities. Similar to Indeed, since this network is more targeted to traditional opportunities, you\u2019ll need to use keywords in your search to find remote-friendly opportunities.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Nomad tip:<br \/>\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on Slack already (which is increasingly common), consider joining communities there to stay connected with the broader nomad community. NomadList\u2019s Slack Channel, for example, brings together 7,000+ nomads from around the world. You can join at www.join.nomadlist.com.\u201d<br \/>\nSofia Miller, Independent Designer, Porto, Portugal<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 48\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<h3>General best practices for the remote job search<\/h3>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 49\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">Here are some words to the wise as you job hunt as a nomad:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sure to keep your profiles complete and up-to-date. This is especially important when it comes to applying to opportunities via established networks like LinkedIn, AngelList and Indeed.<\/li>\n<li>Maintain a spreadsheet of ideal companies or opportunities you come across in your search. Mark the status of your application, so you don\u2019t have to rely on your memory when it comes time to follow-up.<\/li>\n<li>Do your homework! Without the ability to visit an office or meet the team in person, use resources like Glassdoor and The Muse to get a sense of salary expectations (helpful for calculating your rate), cultural watch-outs and other red flags.<\/li>\n<li>If you can, apply via the network or job board, but also use LinkedIn to identify the hiring manager and reach out directly. Tools like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.email-checker.net\">Email Checker<\/a> allow you to verify someone\u2019s email address without ever hitting send.<\/li>\n<li>Although you might be traveling in a faraway land, take proactive steps to remain \u201con the radar\u201d in key markets. This might be as simple as participating in a Twitter chat or Slack channel, contributing thought leadership via LinkedIn Pulse or Medium, offering to participate in a webinar, or connecting with recruiters who pair opportunities in your industry. Make an effort to keep your personal brand relevant and fresh in the markets that will hire you.<\/li>\n<li>Most remote workers can benefit from setting up a simple online portfolio that quickly establishes their skills, previous work\/ partners and contact information. Tools like Squarespace make this relatively easy, but if you want to go even more minimalistic, check out about.me, which reduces the friction of buying and maintaining a formal domain.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">All of this information is just the start in beginning your search for remote work. Once you\u2019ve found the best places to surface opportunities within your industry, schedule a block of time each month (or perhaps once every two weeks) to browse job boards and contact employers. If you\u2019re mostly working on projects, scanning and applying for roles will likely become a core part of your new business strategy and a requirement for keeping your pipeline growing as a remote worker.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Get
