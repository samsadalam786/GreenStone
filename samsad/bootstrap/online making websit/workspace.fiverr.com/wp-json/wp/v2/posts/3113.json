Experience is the best teacher. You learn by doing.<br \/>You\u2019ve probably heard sentiments like those before. But, if you rolled your eyes and thought, \u201cWow, that\u2019s really not all that helpful!\u201d you aren\u2019t alone.<br \/>Sure, maybe things really do look a heck of a lot clearer in your rearview mirror. However, that\u2019s not what you need to hear when you don\u2019t even have the option to look backward quite yet. What if you\u2019re just getting started and trying your best to avoid learning things the hard way?<br \/>It\u2019s in those moments when it\u2019s helpful to rely on other people\u2019s hindsight (sneaky, right?). Yes, you can learn a lot from the experiences of others who have stood in your exact spot before\u2014particularly when it comes to making it as a freelancer.<br \/>So, rather than continuing to spout a bunch of clich\u00e9s at you, we took it upon ourselves to get some juicy information straight from successful freelancers themselves. Here are what a few of them had to say about what they wish they knew before they got started.<\/p>\n<h3>Be Aggressive<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI would have appreciated someone with freelance experience letting me know that it\u2019s okay to be a little bit aggressive. To negotiate the fee attached to my work, to explain why I think design A is better than design B, and to have more conviction. You\u2019re being hired because you\u2019re the expert, so don\u2019t shy away from that.\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Kelly Beall, <a href=\"https:\/\/designcrushblog.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Graphic Designer<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Don\u2019t Forget Your Finances<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cOne thing I struggled with early on that affected me long term was the financial end. There\u2019s much more to it than cranking out work for clients. Anyone who is considering freelance work should find a good local accountant, sit down with them, and learn as much about the financial end of their business as possible.\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Matt Brett, <a href=\"https:\/\/mattbrett.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Web Designer<\/a><br \/><em>Pssssst: Freaking out about your taxes this year?

Almost every editor I know is eager for more writers, and I could have used that to my advantage if I&#8217;d simply asked happy clients, \u2018Do you know anyone who could use a freelancer specializing in career, tech, or productivity?\u2019\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Aja Frost, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ajafrost.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Writer<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Understand the Other Side of Your Business<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThe one thing I wish I knew before freelancing was how to be organized in the business sense. If I could just photograph 100 percent of the time, I&#8217;d be happy\u2014but running your own business requires <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">tracking invoices<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expenses<\/a>, marketing yourself, and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/reports\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">setting budgets<\/a>. I wish I had a more solid understanding of all of that so I could concentrate more on taking pictures when starting out.\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Maddie McGarvey, <a href=\"https:\/\/maddiemcgarvey.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Photographer<\/a><br \/>Know Your Value<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the course of your career, especially if you start to work with larger clients, at some point you&#8217;ll be asked to make a case for your value. Even if you&#8217;re confident about your work, this can catch people by surprise, so it&#8217;s something you should practice. Get comfortable talking clearly and confidently about the value of your work, and why you charge what you charge. This is part of your job.&#8221;<br \/>\u2013 Kevin Twohy, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kevintwohy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Product Designer<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Make Time for Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cI wish I knew to start my day with marketing. It was really easy for me to get sucked into writing, and completely forget to promote myself. That quickly led to a lack of clients. Now, I start my morning with 30 minutes of marketing\u2014which is way less overwhelming than a few hours once per week.\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Jillian Richardson, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thatjillian.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Writer<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Get a Rate in Writing<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cMy first freelance assignment was while I was in college. I was young and didn&#8217;t have a clue, but I was just excited to get an assignment to photograph a music festival that I would have done for free. So, I wish I knew about agreeing to a rate before ever shooting anything for a client. Also, I wish they taught me how to invoice in journalism school. Luckily I had a professor that helped me out with that, but at first I was lost.\u201d<br \/>\u2013 Colin Kerrigan, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colinkerrigan.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance Photographer<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Coulda.
