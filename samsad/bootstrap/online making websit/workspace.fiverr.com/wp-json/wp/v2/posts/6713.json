They\u2019ll choose from the time slots you have available. You can even schedule meetings with multiple attendees. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calendly takes care of time zone differences automatically. It also integrates with other apps, like Google Calendar, Workforce, and other CRMs so that your meetings automatically update everywhere you need them to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free for 1 event type, or $8-12USD for extra features<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Real-Time Communication Tool<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers may be armies of one, but we don\u2019t work in a vacuum. We can have any number of clients on active projects that we need to stay in contact with, and other freelancers that we may be farming work out to. Email is one way to stay connected, but a collaboration tool connects all of your contacts in much more useful ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>We suggest: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/slack.com\/\">Slack<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Slack-desktop-Image.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Slack-desktop-Image.jpg 960w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Slack-desktop-Image-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Slack-desktop-Image-768x480.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best for:<\/strong> Freelancers that manage multiple clients, or networks of subcontractors, vendors, and other project-related contacts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What makes it the best:<\/strong> Slack is a team communication tool that allows you to create conversations, or \u201cchannels\u201d that any number of people can contribute to. You can create channels for specific projects, clients, vendors, or any other topic that\u2019s useful to you. People can be added as necessary. And you can upload files and documents.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Slack makes certain that the people that need to communicate and collaborate can, simply and easily.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as that, there are a bunch of freelancer or industry-specific communities on Slack that you can join to help you feel connected to others while you&#8217;re working on your own. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>The free version is great for freelancers and small teams<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Video Conferencing Tool<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emails and phone calls are effective ways of communicating, but they can\u2019t replace a face-to-face conversation.

Connectivity is included from any device, desktop or mobile. Your attendees don\u2019t need a Zoom account to attend your meetings and you can host up to 100 people. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>They have a free option which is enough for most freelancers. If you need to host longer group meetings, the Pro plan is $14.99\/month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An Email Management Tool<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You send a bunch of emails out to prospects, dust your hands together, put your feet up and wait for responses. But what happens when they don&#8217;t come? Do you start to wonder if you really sent off that outreach email, and sift through your sent emails to look for items you should follow up on? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>No need. Schedule emails in advance, so you&#8217;ll never forget to follow up. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>We suggest: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.boomeranggmail.com\/\">Boomerang<\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"360\" height=\"309\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/SendLater.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9902\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/SendLater.png 360w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/SendLater-300x258.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best for:<\/strong> Freelancers that find they often need to schedule emails to be sent at specific times.

Don&#8217;t want to look too eager when a client sends confirmation of an assignment? But also don&#8217;t want to forget to follow up? Quickly write your follow up, click \u201cSend Later\u201d and then choose the time you want the message sent. The best thing is, you can set it up so it won&#8217;t send if the email is responded to first. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boomerang also lets you resend messages you\u2019ve received so that they arrive back in your inbox at a time that\u2019s more convenient. You select the email, choose the time you want it to reappear, and then Boomerang archives the message. When your delivery time arrives the email is unarchived, set as unread, and bumped to the top of your email list as if it just arrived.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Free for 10 messages per month, $4.99 per month for the Personal Plan<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"project-management-tools\">Project Management Tools<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"738\" height=\"367\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.39.24-pm.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9903\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.39.24-pm.png 738w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-05-29-at-3.39.24-pm-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" \/><figcaption><a href=\"#Back-to-top\">Go back to top\ufeff<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A Task Management Tool<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s likely that you need to work on a lot of different projects, for lots of different clients at once.
