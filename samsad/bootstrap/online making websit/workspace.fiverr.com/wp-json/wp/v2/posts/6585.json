A two-minute chat by the water cooler can turn into 15 minutes of procrastination. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Someone interrupting you asking for help with their project can ruin your train of thought, and <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.idonethis.com\/distractions-at-work\/\">it takes an average of 25 minutes<\/a> to get back to the task you were originally working on. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>By having consistent, uninterrupted time you are much more likely to finish your work quickly and to a higher standard.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Less stress from commuting<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been shown that those who commute less than 30 minutes to work (or not at all if working from home) have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.vitality.co.uk\/media\/long-commutes-costing-a-weeks-worth-of-productivity\/\">seven extra days of productive time<\/a> per year in comparison to those with a longer commute. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>By not having to worry about being late into the office, or deal with the stress and busyness that commuting brings with it, you can enjoy a calmer start to the day. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Having the extra time in your day to enjoy activities you choose, rather than spending an hour traveling, is also beneficial to overall health and stress levels. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2017\/08\/170802134738.htm\">healthier and happier worker will end up being more productive<\/a> over the long run\u2014yet another tangible benefit of working from home.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Minimal office politics <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Office politics cause distractions, upset and stress for workers involved. Having to tiptoe your way around bad office relationships is sure to interrupt the mind and decrease productivity. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Of course, these dynamics can\u2019t be completely avoided when working from home, but they can be kept to a minimal level. You will still need to communicate regularly and engage, but being removed from the situation physically means your productivity shouldn\u2019t suffer as much. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>While it can be a bit more difficult to stay relevant when not in the near vicinity of your coworkers, this can be easily avoided through making a concerted effort with decent communication strategies.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Scheduling around most productive hours<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>For those who don\u2019t work regularly from home, it can, of course, be tempting to make the most of all the creature comforts available to you. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>However, once you enter into the remote work mindset you really can make more efficient use of your time. Remote workers can explore their own schedule and find out what times work best for different tasks. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>The difference between being a morning or night person can be exploited here to its full advantage. It\u2019s significantly easier to enter into your flow state at the time that works for you, without the noise and distractions that would occur in an office. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Less sick days<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>A reduction in stress associated with office life and the commute, along with an improved work-life balance can all contribute towards healthier workers. Overall, remote workers <a href=\"https:\/\/ https:\/\/www.nber.org\/papers\/w18871\">have been shown<\/a> to take less sick days off for such reasons. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Many office workers will also take a sick day in order to not spread illnesses to their coworkers. Remote workers with a simple cold are more likely to continue working, since they&#8217;re used to completing tasks in a home environment. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>A sizeable amount of sick days can also be contributed to workers feeling like they need a break from the office. This, of course, is less of an attractive option when you already work from home. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Try it for yourself<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>After seeing all the reasons why working from home can improve your productivity, why not try it out for yourself? <\/p>\n\n\n<p>On the 10th of April, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.remote-how.com\">Remote-how<\/a> is hosting Global Work From Home Day for employers and employees.
