As a freelancer, you are not just working on ongoing projects, you are also on the constant lookout for more work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per predictions, by 2027,<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" freelancers could represent more than half of the total U.S workforce (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.morganstanley.com\/ideas\/freelance-economy\" target=\"_blank\"> freelancers could represent more than half of the total U.S workforce<\/a>. Let\u2019s face it, the competition is immense and with the boom in the freelance workforce, you need to ensure your profile and skill set stand out.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, the most effective way to get more clients is to market yourself successfully and what better way to start than on the world\u2019s largest professional network: LinkedIn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not living under a rock, you are sure to be having a LinkedIn profile by now but how optimized is it to land you freelance gigs? If you have often wondered why your LinkedIn messages go unanswered or why your job applications get no positive responses, it might be time to reassess and refresh your profile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, here are 10 smart ways to spruce up your LinkedIn profile and win more freelance gigs, without having to spend a penny.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1- <strong>Professional Headshot<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your LinkedIn headshot says a lot about you. Make sure you don\u2019t use awkward selfies or cropped images as your profile picture &#8211; this isn\u2019t Instagram or Facebook. LinkedIn needs to be utilized for professional purposes and your picture needs to reflect that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having an appropriate headshot on LinkedIn is pretty simple. All you need to ensure is that you select a clear headshot wherein you are dressed professionally. Don\u2019t go for busy backgrounds, sweet and simple (against a grey or white background) is much more appreciated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A profile picture is meant to humanize your account and makes it more authentic. So, the worst mistake you can make is having no picture at all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2- <strong>Impactful Headline<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with your headshot, the headline is the first thing people see on LinkedIn. An impactful headline is one that compels people to view your profile.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If condensing your nature of work in 120 characters seems tough, start with listing down the keywords associated with your profession, for instance, content writer, graphic designer, digital strategist, photographer, IT consultant, etc. and don\u2019t forget to incorporate the word \u2018freelancer\u2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people let LinkedIn take the default headline which is your current job title. So, if you are a freelance graphic designer and under \u2018company\u2019 you state \u2018Self-employed\u2019, the default settings will display your headline as \u2018Freelance graphic designer at Self-Employed\u2019. Not the most ideal headline, is it?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, take efforts to customize your LinkedIn headline to truly stand out. It is also a good idea to include any notable awards or published work in the headline.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 &#8211; <strong>Precise Summary<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have enticed people to view your profile, chances are they won\u2019t go through the entire page. So, why not hook them with a powerful summary right in the beginning.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though you might be tempted to write stories, stick to writing crisp and precise summaries that <a href=\"https:\/\/writersperhour.com\/blog\/essay-hooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"hooks the reader (opens in a new tab)\">hooks the reader<\/a>. No one has time for lengthy paragraphs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to sum up your experience and professional goals in a conversational manner, devoid of any jargons. Use relevant keywords and make your summary easily readable with bullet points and short paragraphs. You can also consider embedding as a SlideShare deck or a video that builds on your summary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4 &#8211; <strong>Request for Recommendations<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a freelancer, you need to work extra hard in building your credibility and maintaining a positive image. The best way to achieve that on LinkedIn is by asking for recommendations and endorsements.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is nothing to be shy about when it comes to asking your clients for a recommendation. Make it a habit to ask every client to write you a recommendation as soon as you have completed their project as that is when their memory is still fresh, and you are more likely to get a response.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of an email you can send a client, asking for a recommendation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone\u2019s being stingy, why not write them a recommendation first \u2013 that should make them pay back the favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 &#8211; <strong>Signal Recruiters<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that you can secretly let LinkedIn know that you are actively looking for work?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All you need to do is open your dashboard, click on career interests and turn on the signal that reads \u2018let recruiters know you\u2019re open\u2019. That way you signal recruiters that you are open to more offers without having to spell it out on your headline (which is a complete no-no).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6 &#8211; <strong>Showcase your Portfolio<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you thought LinkedIn was just about listing down your work experience and qualifications, you are mistaken. There is a lot more this platform offers you so do maximize it for your own good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, LinkedIn allows you to embed links, videos, PDFs, images and other rich media as a means of showcasing your portfolio of work. Along with embedding, you should also write a line or two describing the work done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are a logo designer or a photographer, it helps to showcase your notable work on your profile. Similarly, if you are a freelance writer, you should also consider adding the books, magazines and articles that you have authored under \u2018Publications\u2019.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7 &#8211; <strong>Connect with Potential Clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you stumble upon a potential client you would like to work for, send them an invite to connect. The idea is to not bombard them immediately with your services but connect with them on similar topics and strike a conversation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that they are part of your network, you can keep an eye on their status updates and shares to understand their interests and needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the time is right, you can subtly <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-steps-to-write-cold-emails-that-convert-freelance-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"express your interest to work with them (opens in a new tab)\">express your interest to work with them<\/a> or pitch a solution that could be of use to them. The key is to connect with the right people. For instance, if you are a freelance writer, you rather connect with editors or content managers whose work is in line with yours rather than CXOs who have bigger things to manage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8 &#8211; <strong>Actively Engage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a profile on LinkedIn is not enough.You need to be active on it in order to make it work for you. You can look at posting your opinion, recent work done or even share an interesting article you came across on your page. You should also spend some time leaving quality comments on people\u2019s posts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By actively engaging on LinkedIn, you are strengthening your brand image and improving your recall value. Moreover, LinkedIn\u2019s algorithm is such that it pushes your profile or content if you regularly engage with your network. So, make your presence felt and make it a point to post or comment on LinkedIn, at least thrice a week.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9 &#8211; <strong>Participate in Groups<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>LinkedIn Groups give you direct access to professionals sharing a similar line of work. Now, that\u2019s a serious goldmine and the possibilities of finding new work and making connections are endless.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use Groups to start healthy discussions, comment on other people\u2019s posts and make connections. It is also a great place to get feedback on your work. As a freelancer, there are essentially 2 types of groups you should focus on: one that is filled with freelancers where you can share best practices, tips and learn from each other\u2019s experiences and the other which has a mix of freelancers and clients which can be used to find new projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, type the keyword associated with your field of work on the search bar, filter by \u2018groups\u2019 and there you have a list of groups that would be of interest to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10 &#8211; <strong>Publish on LinkedIn Pulse<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pulse is LinkedIn\u2019s built-in news aggregation feed which allows users to create engaging content to enhance their reputation. This tool is especially beneficial for freelance writers and content creators who can turn to it for sharing original and engaging content.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It lets you highlight your services and strengths while expanding your reach to a wide professional network.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per LinkedIn, in order to ensure your article gets featured on the Pulse feed and gets maximum visibility, you need to \u2018write content that resonates with your connections, followers, and target audience. The most meaningful and high-quality articles will be promoted through member feedback, including views, likes, comments, and shares.\u2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also a good idea to subscribe to Pulse channels that are of interest to you and gain inspiration from articles that are performing well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, your LinkedIn profile is always a work in progress. Keep updating it regularly with new projects and developments. If used smartly, it can really prove to be a useful freelance-friendly tool that lets you build a strong online persona.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, don\u2019t stop at just having a profile, spend quality time engaging on the platform to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/working-11-marketing-materials-youll-need\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"market
