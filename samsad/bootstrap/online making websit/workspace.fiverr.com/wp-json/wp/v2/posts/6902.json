That\u2019s part of both the excitement and the stress of running your freelance business. Instead of having someone to sell services for you, you have to do it yourself. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>In this article, veteran sales experts share their best tips, and the good news is, they aren\u2019t complicated or confusing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve never done sales, or find that you fail to close nearly every sales call you take, use these tips to start <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/new-freelance-leads\/\">bringing in new clients<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<h2>1. <strong>Know your product\u2019s value<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>This may seem obvious, but it\u2019s easy to lead with a feature-based conversation, rather than a value- and benefits-based conversation. Sam Meenasian, Vice President of Sales and Marketing Operations for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsuranceusa.com\/\">USA Business Insurance<\/a> says, <\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cPeople want to see value and someone who is knowledgeable always gets the customer. Whether it is a tangible product or not, the buyer wants to know they\u2019re not wasting their money.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s more, this actually makes selling easier, Meenasian explains: \u201cWhen you know exactly what you are offering, there is no need to go outside of your box to sell.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Before taking another sales call, create a list of <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-price-your-freelance-services-for-more-revenue-and-less-headaches\/\">value-based <\/a>topics you can bring into your conversation with the potential client. For example, rather than saying you\u2019re a great communicator, you might say you answer emails within 24 hours so you\u2019re always available when they need you most.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>2. <strong>Don\u2019t make assumptions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve done the necessary research before your sales call, you may go in with preconceived ideas of what the potential client wants or needs from you. This is your first mistake, suggests Lee Dyson, owner of <a href=\"https:\/\/heymisterdj.com\/\">Hey Mister DJ<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>His number one sales tip is to eliminate your assumptions. \u201cMost salespeople let their internal biases affect how they present their service or product based on what they assume is most important to a client, instead of just asking.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>When booking DJ clients, for example, Dyson says they ask many questions about what the couple wants, what they have in mind, and how they want their guests to feel. The answers are then used to cater the closing pitch to the specific needs and wants of the client. In the end, Dyson says: \u201cMost clients end up saying \u2018WOW, you totally get us!\u2019\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Turn your sales call into a case study<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Testimonials have been proven time and time again to drive sales online. Why not bring this technique to your sales calls too? <\/p>\n\n\n<p>Julie Doig McPeek, who started her career in sales at Procter &amp; Gamble and has been running her own brand strategy and marketing services company, <a href=\"https:\/\/provisormarketing.com\/\">Provisor Marketing<\/a>, for the past 17 years, explains how easy it is to do this:<\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cIn your sales pitch, give examples of the types of businesses you can help so that your prospect can say \u2018that\u2019s me!\u2019\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>To do so, you just need to prepare ahead of time, looking for stats and data you can reference during the call. Don\u2019t complicate the conversation with confusing numbers and instead, keep it high-level. Offer to send more information later if they\u2019re interested.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>4. <strong>Really know your ideal client<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Any business guide will tell you this, and Dwayne Vera, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/saleslegendacademy.com\/\">Sales Legend Academy<\/a> says it\u2019s critical to figure out as soon as possible. As a freelancer, this is easy to overlook\u2014you need business and you need it now, so you may be willing to take on anyone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut there is nothing worse than having a client who is a poor fit,\u201d says Vera. He continues, \u201cPoor fit clients can become customer experience nightmares, possibly resulting in poor reputation.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>When you know what client you want, you \u201cunderstand their pains, motivations, and desires,\u201d explains Vera, which allows you&nbsp;to sell better and be more authentic in your pitch. If you haven\u2019t figured this out yet, use <a href=\"https:\/\/kimgarst.com\/7-steps-to-identify-your-ideal-customer-or-client\/\">this guide from Kim Garst<\/a> to identify your ideal client and start selling better.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>5. <strong>Educate, don\u2019t sell<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Your instinct on a sales call is to do exactly that: sell. However, Ashton T. Harvey, who took a failing territory generating 500K in annual revenue to 1.5 million in 2 years, and founded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thesignificantedge.com\/\">The Significant Edge<\/a>, says to educate first and foremost.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cEveryone is trying to sell everyone, but people do not buy from people who sell\u2014they buy from people who educate.\u201d <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>What does it mean to educate? It means to listen and understand, says Harvey: \u201cMost people do not know they need something until they hear it come out of their own mouth.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Instead of focusing first on your sales pitch, start by educating the potential client on what your product or service is and how it works. This naturally leads you to ask the questions needed to close with confidence.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>6. <strong>Build selling into your daily routine<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>It sounds exhausting, but focusing on selling every day helps you avoid the even more exhausting daily stress\u2014not knowing when your next client will come through\u2014says Scott Ingram, Host of the <a href=\"https:\/\/top1.fm\/dailysalestips\/\">Daily Sales Tips podcast<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>\u201cAvoid the feast or famine rollercoaster that is all too common to freelance work by carving a set amount of time out of each day for sales activities. Ideally this should be a combination of prospecting, follow-up, client outreach and referral gathering.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>In this way, you\u2019re regularly contacting and connecting with potential clients, increasing your chances of success. This means there should be space in your calendar each day for one of these sales processes: prospecting, follow-up, and current client outreach.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2><strong>Become a better salesperson<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Use these tips to take your sales up a level, earning more clients and stressing less. Don\u2019t forget to educate, know your product, ask questions, and stick with it every day of the week. The better you get at sales, the more your business can grow, so use these ideas to get better at selling once and for all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this article,
