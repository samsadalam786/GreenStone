But, before you immediately reply with an enthusiastic, \u201cYes! I\u2019ll absolutely do it!\u201d it\u2019s important for you to take some time and ensure that this opportunity is something you should actually take on.<br \/>\nAs an <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/how-to-freelance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">independent hustler<\/a>, it\u2019s easy to fall into the trap of thinking that you should gladly accept every last gig that falls in your lap (you should enjoy the feast before the famine strikes, right?). However, successful freelancers know it\u2019s better to be a little selective and confirm that the project is a good fit for you before you find yourself knee-deep in a mess.<br \/>\nSo, how can you evaluate a new gig and determine if you should move forward? Start by asking yourself these five questions.<\/p>\n<h3>Can I complete this by the established deadline?<\/h3>\n<p>As tempting as it can be to pile your freelance plate full, you don\u2019t want to end up with so much work on your to-do list that you begin missing deadlines, sacrificing quality, and letting little details slip through the cracks.<br \/>\nThis is why that it\u2019s important for you to take a hard look at your current workload as well as the assigned deadline for this project. You need to ensure that you have the adequate bandwidth and time in your schedule to get the work done well and on time. One way to ensure this? Practice diligent <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">time-tracking<\/a>, so you know exactly how many hours are going to each existing project.<\/p>\n<h3>Does the offered rate fit my expectations?<\/h3>\n<p>Tying back to that feast or famine mentality, you can often find yourself throwing caution to the wind and accepting low-rate work in the interest of having some money rolling in. Something is better than nothing, right?<br \/>\nHowever, this isn\u2019t a smart strategy for a couple of reasons. First, it devalues your business and your skills. If you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re worthy of what you typically charge, why should anybody else? And, secondly, the freelance world is small\u2014people talk. You\u2019ll have a tough time ever charging another client your normal price if you dip way below your standard rate during a slow period.<br \/>\nRemember not to get so swept up in the excitement of a brand new gig that you neglect to look at the numbers. If the rate doesn\u2019t match up with your expectations, it\u2019s probably better to pass.<\/p>\n<h3>Is this client legitimate?<\/h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, there are plenty of scams that freelancers fall victim to. With the anonymity that the internet grants, it\u2019s become increasingly difficult to separate the wheat from the chaff in regards to prospective clients.<br \/>\nEnter the importance of doing your research. Do some digging online\u2014use resources like LinkedIn or even this client\u2019s website\u2014to find out more about who you\u2019d be working for. You can also do some searching to see if there are any negative reviews from people (whether they\u2019re customers or other contractors) who have worked with this person or company before.<br \/>\nThere\u2019s no tried and true way to guarantee that an opportunity will pan out the way you expected. But, doing some detective work before accepting will help you avoid getting yourself into a bad situation.<\/p>\n<h3>Do I mesh well with this client?<\/h3>\n<p>Alright, so the work this client is offering doesn\u2019t seem like a scam. But, don\u2019t stop your considerations there. You should also take some time to think about whether or not you and this prospective client (and any other team members you\u2019d be working with) will mesh well.<br \/>\nAny freelancer who has experienced a tense client relationship will speak to the importance of finding clients that are best suited to you. You don\u2019t need to be fast friends, but you ultimately should have compatible communication styles and approaches to work.<br \/>\nLook back on your correspondence so far and consider how they\u2019ve been to work with. Have they been frustratingly slow to respond or vague in their directions or requirements? If anything is making you uneasy about the prospect of working with them, you might want to give this some more thought.<\/p>\n<h3>Am I excited about the work?<\/h3>\n<p>Freelancing pays your bills. But, remember, you got into this field because you were passionate about the work you were doing. And, you still deserve to feel that inspired by the projects you choose to work on.<br \/>\nSo, ask yourself if this gig excites you. Is your mind already swimming with different ideas, or do you just let out an exhausted groan when thinking about even getting started on this project?<br \/>\nYes, any job\u2014freelancing included\u2014will require you to tackle some tasks you\u2019d rather not deal with every now and then (<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">expense tracking<\/a>, anyone?). But, if this gig is filling you with dread, it\u2019s probably better to pass and save yourself for an opportunity that\u2019s a better fit.<br \/>\nLanding a new freelance gig is exciting. However, you can\u2019t get so swept up in the thrill of new work that you neglect to consider whether or not this is an opportunity you should realistically take on.<br \/>\nTake time to reflect on these five questions before accepting a freelance gig, and you\u2019ll be sure to fill your client roster and to-do list with work that\u2019s the best fit for you.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/?utm_source=hustleco&amp;utm_campaign=blog_break&amp;utm_medium=blog_post&amp;utm_term=SXSW\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-166\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/blog-breaker.png\" alt=\"BannerRetina\" width=\"100%\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Landing a new freelance gig is exciting.
