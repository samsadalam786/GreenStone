There are obvious benefits to self-employment, as well as some challenges\u2014the most common being the irregular cadence of work. One way to maintain a more consistent project flow is to build\u00a0an active pipeline of future clients.<br \/>\nThere are several potential pathways for drumming up new business, and freelancers in different industries will give priority to certain channels over others. For inbound requests\u2014that is, recruiters coming to you with specific gigs or projects\u2014LinkedIn stands out as one of the most universal ways to get found.<br \/>\nWith about <a href=\"https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/money\/careers\/articles\/2015\/02\/19\/what-recruiters-think-when-they-see-your-linkedin-profile\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">94 percent of recruiters<\/a> using LinkedIn to source and vet job candidates, it\u2019s important to do all you can to stand out from the crowd. Similar to how a marketer might optimize a website for organic search queries, freelancers can make adjustments to their LinkedIn pages to increase discoverability and conversion.<br \/>\nHere, we outline three ways to improve your LinkedIn profile in the next 15 minutes.<\/p>\n<h3>Recommendations: All you gotta do is ask<\/h3>\n<p>Ever notice a colleague or connection whose LinkedIn profile is chock full of glowing recommendations? Chances are, they didn\u2019t land on those by sheer luck. The secret to getting more recommendations is\u2014surprise!\u2014to ask for them. Why recommendations, you ask? Word-of-mouth is a powerful thing, and believe it or not, these tiny blurbs that vouch for your credibility and professionalism can be the difference between signing that SOW and missing out on an opportunity.<br \/>\n\u201cA LinkedIn recommendation is incredibly valuable when searching for freelance work because it is third-party validation of the quality and high-level of work you perform,\u201d says Jessica Hernandez, president and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/greatresumesfast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Great Resumes Fast<\/a>, a company that assists job seekers with the LinkedIn profile, resume and cover letter creation process.<br \/>\nAs you look to request recommendations from your colleagues, think about which skills you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/linkedin\/5-best-practices-requesting-linkedin-recommendations-01033598\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highlight<\/a> on your profile. For example, you may want to contact an editor you have worked with in the past if you want to draw attention to your writing skills. Reach out to staff members who have worked on projects with you if your goal is to hone in on your leadership skills.<br \/>\nTry to be as specific as possible when you are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/williamarruda\/2015\/07\/14\/the-best-way-to-request-and-receive-linkedin-recommendations\/#407dffd3750b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">requesting a recommendation<\/a> from a colleague to ensure that he or she gives you a valuable review. You may want to even explain why you are seeking a recommendation. For instance, if you inform your colleague that you are looking to move into the communications field, he or she may add examples of your work in this area in the recommendation.<\/p>\n<h3>Branding yourself starts with your current position<\/h3>\n<p>Sure, you have a mountain of experience under your belt in terms of the various positions you\u2019ve held as a freelancer. That being said, you might overlook your <em>current<\/em> role as it\u2019s communicated on LinkedIn, which is important since this what will appear at the top of your profile page.<br \/>\nYour professional headline is what appears under your name on your LinkedIn profile. You can select your most recent position to display as your headline, or you can customize it with a creative (or perhaps keyword-rich) descriptor of your own. For instance, LinkedIn may auto-generate \u201cManager at Retail Store\u201d if you have this listed as your most current position. However, you have the option to change this and write in what you like.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMany times, people will title themselves as \u2018Unemployed\u2019 or \u2018Seeking Employment,\u2019\u201d says Jen Teague, who coaches small businesses on how to hire professionals. \u201cTo me, it is better to leave the field blank than to label yourself as \u2018Unemployed.\u2019 Ones that [have] caught my eye are \u2018Future CEO,\u2019 \u2018Your next CSR\u2019 and other positive descriptions. Those are creative ways to show an employer you\u2019re serious about finding work.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As a freelancer, you might want to create a \u201ccatch all\u201d experience section. This involves rounding up at least a handful of recommendations, creating a slideshow that highlights your best work, and summarizing what you do for clients in an easy-to-read bullet point format. Once you have your \u201ccatch all\u201d section completed, you can craft a customized professional headline that reflects the key skills and experience you have under your belt.<br \/>\nFor example, if your \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/nextavenue\/2014\/12\/08\/how-freelancers-should-create-linkedin-profiles\/2\/#2bdac96842ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">catch all<\/a>\u201d experience has several bullet points that highlight your content marketing skills, your professional headline could be, \u201cVersatile Digital Marketing Freelance Consultant.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Craft a compelling story about your self-employment<\/h3>\n<p>As you look to enhance your LinkedIn profile, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re a small fish in a big pond full of other freelancers\u2014how will you stand out from the rest? Employers want to know what you can bring to the table and why it\u2019s different than what they might receive from another candidate with your experience.<br \/>\nLinkedIn can be seen as a simple-to-use canvas for professional storytelling. Use the top sections of your profile to\u00a0instantly grab the attention of profile viewers and hold onto it\u2014your goal should be to keep hiring managers scrolling. After that, you\u00a0want them to continuing reading through\u00a0your experiences, recommendations and\u00a0work examples.<br \/>\nTo grasp the attention of your audience, start out strong with a creative professional headline. Try to avoid using words that may generalize your position. For example, if you are a writer, don\u2019t simply list yourself as a \u201cFreelance Writer.\u201d Think creatively: \u201cDigital Journalist and Experienced Editor\u201d can round up your skills and provide more exact details on your experience in the industry.<br \/>\n\u201cFreelancers should avoid posting bare bones work summary sections in which they fail to provide detailed information about their previous experiences,\u201d says Brittany King, senior recruiter and founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecareercollective.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Career Collective<\/a>, an organization that works with employees interested in improving and expanding their career skills.<br \/>\nHowever, it\u2019s important to avoid \u201cfluffing\u201d up your summaries. Keeping your job descriptions light and informative can ensure that you aren\u2019t turning off recruiters.<br \/>\n\u201cI don&#8217;t want to be wading through a lot of hyperbole to learn whether you fit my bill,\u201d says hiring manager Kevin Robson with Capable Consultants Limited, a recruitment company that connects organizations with experienced job seekers.<br \/>\nBy taking these basic tips into account, you can keep recruiters interested in your LinkedIn profile and demonstrate why you&#8217;re\u00a0a fit for the open position before the first conversation ever takes place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many self-employed people, LinkedIn is a top source for prospecting and recruiter discovery.
