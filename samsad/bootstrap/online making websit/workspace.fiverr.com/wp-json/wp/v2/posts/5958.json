Keeping current on the latest <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/blog\/trends\/graphic-design-trends-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">graphic design trends<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is essential to remain competitive in an always-changing marketplace. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, we thought we\u2019d give you a headstart for 2019. We\u2019ve analyzed and collected emerging design trends across the board\u2014graphic design, logo design, web design, and more\u2014to showcase what we predict to be the next big trends in branding. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re building your own brand or making these decisions for a client, use them today to show you\u2019re on the cutting edge of your industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5987\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/2019-Graphic-Design-Trends-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"Design trends for 2019\" width=\"1860\" height=\"1090\"><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>1. Serifs <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The recent rise of serifs shows that minimalism\u2019s domination of the digital realm is starting to crack. That\u2019s not to say that minimalism is going away any time soon\u2014as you can see in some trends below, it still remains highly influential. But recently we\u2019re seeing more tolerance for designs that are far from minimal, including ornamental serifs. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Serifs refer to those little tags on letters, and the fonts that use them. Their opposition are the sans serif fonts\u2014letters with no tags\u2014which until recently have been crowding web design as part of the minimalism movement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5959\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Medium-serif-fonts-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"930\" height=\"464\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via&nbsp;<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medium<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But now serifs are making a comeback as a font trend for 2019, perhaps as part of a larger pull towards more traditional times (we talk about the popularity of vintage logos below). Whatever the reason, you won\u2019t be alone if you choose an elegant serif font to add a little sophistication and class to your brand. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And as part of the serif trend, a sub-trend has developed using high-contrast weights. If you\u2019re not a typographile, that means a combination of stick-thin lines and bold, fat lines\u2014typically the upstroke is thinner than the downstroke. This makes the visuals of your text more dynamic and noticeable, but can be distracting if used with other \u201cloud\u201d elements.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5960\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Aviva-Home-Page-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"930\" height=\"456\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.avivatalmon.co.il\/\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aviva<\/span><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>2. Thumb-friendly mobile navigation<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s been a couple of years since <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/nov\/02\/mobile-web-browsing-desktop-smartphones-tablets\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mobile devices beat out desktop for browsing the internet<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, but design trends are now starting to catch up. The first of our \u201cmobile-friendly\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/blog\/trends\/web-design-trends-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web design trends<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> involves something that, in retrospect, seems so obvious: designing navigation for thumbs. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, navigation menus like hamburger icons were usually situated in the top left or right corners to coincide with desktop sites. But since research shows how nearly all (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@subsign\/vertical-vs-horizontal-video-2ed0a76a02ce\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">94%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) of mobile users prefer their thumbs over their fingers, designers are rethinking that setup.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5961\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Water-dripping-app-1.gif\" alt=\"Water dripping app\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3997043-Watering-Tracker-App\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">tubik<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Dribbble<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trend now is placing navigation elements at the bottom of mobile sites and apps to facilitate thumb navigation. Users no longer have to change how they hold their phones to open menus, allowing for more intuitive usability. It\u2019s because of this practical benefit to UX that we\u2019ll see more and more of this navigation in 2019. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a trend you can apply to your own brand just as much as that of your clients. Statistically speaking, chances are the majority of visitors to your portfolio site are viewing it on mobile. Giving those visitors a better user experience can only improve your first impression. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>3. Vertical Videos<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our second \u201cmobile-friendly\u201d trend is part of the larger movement around videos, one of the most popular types of content for all things online. With tech advancements and better data packages for mobile devices, demand for video content continues to grow with no sign of slowing down. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a result, people are starting to film and post more mobile-friendly videos, in particular vertical video. While shooting vertical (portrait) videos was once considered an online faux pas, the powerful shift to mobile has since changed people\u2019s perspective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5963\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/IGTV-press-photo-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"808\" height=\"688\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/instagram-press.com\/blog\/2018\/06\/20\/welcome-to-igtv\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IGTV<\/span><\/i><\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The trend was likely started by social media platforms like Snapchat and Instagram Stories (and later IGTV), but has now infiltrated more mainstream channels: pop-star musicians are now shooting <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highsnobiety.com\/p\/vertical-music-videos\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">vertical music videos<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and even <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/13\/espn-launches-a-short-form-version-of-sportscenter-on-snapchat\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ESPN adapted SportsCenter<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to fit vertically on Snapchat. The beauty of this trend is that it can used by big brands and individuals alike\u2014keep it in mind the next time you\u2019re recording something for social media.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. \u201cFriendlier\u201d Geometrics<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the last couple of years, we started seeing more geometric shapes all over the design world: shapes with sharp corners and rigid lines, large grids extending out into the distance, repeated patterns of intermingling shapes for backgrounds, etc. While that trend itself is still growing, it\u2019s also learning from its mistakes and changing its trajectory for \u201cfriendlier\u201d territory. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While their structure and order are appealing, the problem with geometric shapes is that they can come off as cold and impersonal, even oppressive at extremes. Designers have learned to temper this drawback using two tactics in particular: warm colors and curves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5964\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Inky-screenshot-design-trends-for-2019-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Inky screenshot - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"723\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/briorom\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BrioRom<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Warm colors like pastels are inherently more comforting and inviting than darker shades, so using them makes geometric designs less intimidating. Adding more curves and waves to otherwise straight lines also makes the images more playful and less threatening. Play with the degrees of each until you reach the perfect balance between structure and whimsy that represents your brand identity. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>5. Asymmetry<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially in web design, asymmetrical layouts are starting to pop up everywhere. Some say it\u2019s a way for professionally designed sites to differentiate themselves from the template-builder sites like Squarespace or Canva; others say the trend is a rebellion against the structure of the geometrics trend above. Regardless, if you want to market yourself as edgy or as someone who thinks outside of the box, asymmetry is a good way to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5965\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cloco-screenshot-design-trends-for-2019-1.png\" alt=\"Cloco screenshot - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"1128\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/1611496\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mila Jones Cann<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When done well, asymmetrical layouts perfectly break the mold with stimulating and memorable visuals. But the key is doing them right\u2014because there\u2019s no built-in structure, designers have to balance compositions on their own. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>6. 3D imagery<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The better tech gets, the higher users\u2019 expectations rise. With HD visuals, faster loading times, and more advanced design tools, people today demand visuals that wow and impress, which paves the way for our next trend: 3D imagery.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5966\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Campus-Jack-design-trends-for-2019-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Campus Jack - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"930\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/1479376\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EFL<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not to be confused with actual 3D in movies, or with AR and VR trends that are still on the horizon, the trend we\u2019re describing here involves using ultra-realistic, thoroughly rendered visuals. The 3D imagery of 2019 will incorporate highly polished graphics to bring abstract shapes to life\u2014even typography. Part art and part tech, 3D imagery perfectly represents modern design\u2019s craving for next-level futurism.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5967\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Mulher-logo-design-trends-for-2019-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mulher logo - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"399\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/www.behance.net\/gallery\/71276031\/Mulher-3D-Type\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Di\u00eago Soou<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Behance.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><b>7. Custom Fonts<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s not just images and photographs that are getting a makeover. Fonts are also updating their standards based on what\u2019s popular. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We already mentioned the return of serifs, but another typographic trend for 2019 is custom fonts, original or rare fonts with telltale looks. After all, typography is just another opportunity to showcase your brand identity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5968\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Choice-Maple-Logo-design-trends-for-2019-1.jpg\" alt=\"Choice Maple Logo - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"620\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/yokaona\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yokaona<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Handwritten fonts, in particular, are on the rise, as are <a href=\"https:\/\/wpamelia.com\/cursive-fonts\/\">loopy cursive fonts<\/a>. We\u2019re also seeing more blocky outline fonts. Rather than the big and bold letters we\u2019ve seen since the mid-2010s, these fonts simply outline the letters with transparent insides. This trend makes big blocky letters less oppressive, and also allows better visibility for background hero images.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5969\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Backroads-Brewing-Co-Screenshot-design-trends-for-2019-1.jpg\" alt=\"Backroads Brewing Co Screenshot - design trends for 2019\" width=\"930\" height=\"378\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/940180\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">simplest\u2122<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>8. Detailing<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those who don\u2019t fit well with minimalistic styles are going for the polar opposite: elaborate detailing. While other sites are stripping away the details from the visuals, this school of design is adding as many as they can.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5970\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/The-hand-and-eye-logo-2019-design-trends-1.png\" alt=\"The hand and eye logo - 2019 design trends\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\"><\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/BSteely\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brian Steely<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Dribbble<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can recognize this style easily by advanced techniques like line shading and photorealism. This trend goes perfectly with hand-drawn illustrations, allowing artists to flex their muscles to the fullest with images that could fit just as well in an art museum as they do a website background.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>9. Vintage Logos<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No industry is immune from fierce competition anymore. With new companies popping up every day and every one claiming to be the best, brands and freelancers alike are looking for ways to prove their authenticity amidst a sea of pretenders. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One shortcut many brands take is using a vintage logo. Because the visuals are reminiscent of decades past, simply using this style is enough to suggest your company has a successful history, even if it just launched yesterday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5971\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Copper-Cane-Distilling-logo-2019-design-trends-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Copper &amp; Cane Distilling logo - 2019 design trends\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1990\">Via <\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/99designs.com\/profiles\/jeegy\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jeegy\u2122<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on 99designs<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Characteristics of this trend include a circular frame, \u201cestablished\u201d year, and textured overlays that make the logo look weathered by time. Of course, you can personalize your approach depending on how you want to come off by mixing and matching elements of vintage logos with modern logos. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>10. Duotone gradients<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last, we end with the merging of two trends from years past to create a wholly new trend for the future. The duotone trend, reducing an image to just two contrasting colors, became popular a few years ago thanks to Spotify. But now, and more-so in 2019, the duotone trend is seeing a resurgence thanks to the help of gradients, or \u201ccolor transitions,\u201d which fade into one another.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5972\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Duotone-gradients-2019-design-trends-1.png\" alt=\"Duotone gradients - 2019 design trends\" width=\"568\" height=\"568\"><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Via<\/span><\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/3692353--static-eyes-57-Explore-Sonhe-Descubra\"> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bruno Pego<\/span><\/i><\/a><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Dribbble<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On paper the two don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d mesh together, but in practice they actually work well for creating an interesting and unique look that can set your brand apart.
