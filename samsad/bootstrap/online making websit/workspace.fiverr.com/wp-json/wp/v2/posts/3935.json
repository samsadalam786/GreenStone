After leaving advertising agency AKQA last year,\u00a0where she was the Creative Director, she started Secret Code, an innovative children&#8217;s book that stars YOUR girl as a tech hero. Oh, and she&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.girlboss.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GirlBoss contributor<\/a>. We were lucky enough to catch up with her about what she&#8217;s learned\u00a0from her illustrious creative\u00a0endeavors, her tips on working independently, and why making a difference is her first priority.<\/p>\n<h3>You&#8217;re introducing yourself to someone at a party. What do you say when they ask what you do?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cOh no, not that question! Why don\u2019t I ask you this: what was YOUR first internet handle?\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>How would you articulate your personal brand story? What&#8217;s the headline?<\/h3>\n<p>Trying to do stuff that matters. Emphasis on \u201ctrying\u201d because it\u2019s not an easy journey, and it\u2019s super pompous to have that as a headline. But I do gravitate towards that. I\u2019m constantly haunted by the problems on this planet, and want to contribute to fixing them in any means I can. I don\u2019t care about earning big bucks if it makes me want to shoot myself for being a corporate slave. I think our world is obsessed with money and titles, and we\u2019re brainwashed to think it\u2019s almost all that matters.<br \/>\nThat being said, I\u2019m only in my 30s. Who knows, maybe in my 40s I\u2019ll be like, \u201cI need a yacht asap.\u201d But I\u2019m also lucid with how our minds progress as we age, and we start thinking about our kids\u2019 futures and all that grownup stuff. Honestly, who knows.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s your favorite location to work from, or where are you most productive?<\/h3>\n<p>Anywhere but at home. It\u2019s really hard to stay focused when you\u2019re trying to make your home a decent place to live in for your partner and yourself. I happen to have an amazing and very clean husband who does everything if I don\u2019t. And right now the balance isn\u2019t great. I tend to want to work until I drop, and ignore everything around me (basically, the house is in a mess). So being far from home is best so I don\u2019t feel guilty of not cleaning up. That sounds like a horrible answer,\u00a0but a productive one!<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of your best and worst work habits?<\/h3>\n<p><em>Best:<\/em> I\u2019m really good at getting going and ignoring all the potential obstacles that can paralyze the progress of a project. People are like, \u201cBut&#8230;what if this happens? Have you considered this? You should be careful with this,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNaaah&#8230;And, if it happens, it will be an amazing lesson!&#8221; *Grin*<br \/>\n<em>Worst:<\/em> I can get sidetracked by random people\u2019s opinions. This is a huge flaw that many would be embarrassed to admit but I\u2019ll just consider this as therapy. I respect people\u2019s opinions a lot, because I respect everyone\u2019s diverse experiences. But at some point you just need to trust your gut and not care about making the mistakes people are warning you against, because listening to everyone can give you a lot of doubt\u2014and make you less productive. Plus, wanting to do something that pleases everyone is counterproductive. It just makes no one care at the end of the day. It\u2019s a delicate balance to strike: trying to be effective but not (too) offensive.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the biggest perk of working independently? What&#8217;s the hardest part?<\/h3>\n<p>Biggest: Freedom feels obviously amazing.<br \/>\nHardest: Not to be around people. I\u2019m an introvert who needs alone time to recharge, but I also miss the energy of others. Having people who tell you about their own projects is really inspiring. And swapping opinions and helping each other out also makes your work move forward faster. I\u2019ve often spent days and weeks noodling something that just took a conversation to solve.<\/p>\n<h3>Is there a \u2018dream gig\u2019 that would make you give up what you\u2019re doing now?<\/h3>\n<p>If I was offered a job that was helping the world become a better place, like work for the government, education, social justice&#8230;I\u2019d be all over that 9 to 5.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s one \u201chustler hack\u201d that you&#8217;ve perfected?<\/h3>\n<p>Shut down your email while you work. Put your phone in another room. Interruptions are why you end your days exhausted, with thoughts like, \u201cWhat the hell did I do today?\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s one tool or utility that you couldn&#8217;t live without?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve recently discovered Airmail. It\u2019s like, where have you been all my life?! It has all my emails in one program but it\u2019s better than Outlook because you can label emails, and not be forced into putting them in folders. I also appreciate the design and UX details. Airmail looks like it\u2019s been made by a team who cares.<\/p>\n<h3>In your opinion, what is the most important personality trait that one must have to find success as an entrepreneur?<\/h3>\n<p>Resilience. I\u2019ve heard this said several times by successful startup founders: \u201cSuccessful startups outwork their competitors.\u201d It sounds depressing, but I think it\u2019s true. In an age of mass democratization of tools, there\u2019s going to be mass competition. You just need to keep going and continue believing in yourself. That\u2019s the hard part. Being an entrepreneur is a rollercoaster of emotions. Sometimes you\u2019re like \u201cThis is the most amazing feeling in the universe,\u201d and the next day, you\u2019re like \u201cThis project blows. No one cares. Why don\u2019t I go back to the easy life with health insurance and a bi-monthly paycheck?\u201d<br \/>\nJust keep going. And surround yourself with people who believe in you. Because negative people do affect your morale\u2014and your business.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Want to see Mara Lecocq\u2019s current hustle?
