More than simply dealing with problems that arise in a friendly and timely way, that means proactively finding ways to make a <a href=\"https:\/\/userpilot.com\/blog\/improve-customer-satisfaction\/\">customer\u2019s interactions with your product more delightful<\/a>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way I see it, working in customer service is kind of like working in the postal service. There is <em>always<\/em> going to be a constant flow of mail coming in that needs to be collected, sorted, and delivered, but you also have to find time for other tasks like stocking shelves in the store, or considering new products and offers. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means you need to handle all the reactive tasks really efficiently, know what you want to do proactively, and build out time to work on those proactive tasks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These three steps will help you build a great customer service team:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Focus on <em>quality<\/em> first: make sure every interaction you have provides an exceptional experience for the customer. &nbsp;<\/li><li>Build these quality interactions into something replicable, so you can efficiently handle the <em>quantity<\/em> of requests. <\/li><li>Once you\u2019ve got a strong handle on your incoming queries, you can find ways to go from reactive to <em>proactive<\/em>. <\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter mx-auto text-center\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Ran into a bug in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andco<\/a> invoicing a few weeks back and gave them a heads up.

A unified tone of voice <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing every customer support team needs is a clear style guide to reference. Customers should feel a consistent tone in all their interactions with your company. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At AND CO, we encourage support staff to engage in small talk with customers. Not only does this disarm them (especially if they\u2019re coming to you with a problem), it conveys empathy and humanness, helping you to build relationships of trust. And the best part is you get to learn about someone\u2019s life!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Really listen<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When we engage in small talk with our customers, it\u2019s not just because that\u2019s part of our style guide. One of the things that makes our team special is that we\u2019re <em>actually listening<\/em>. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>People know we listen\u2014it\u2019s become our reputation amongst our members. And if people feel heard, they\u2019ll trust you enough to give you good ideas about how you can improve your product. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our members know that we keep track of feature requests, because we follow up with them when their request is implemented (even if it\u2019s been a year since they brought it up!). This helps our members to feel involved in the narrative of AND CO, since they\u2019re shaping the product as much as anyone. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">All y&#39;all wish you had the level of customer service <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andco<\/a> provides.

Our members almost do our work for us by providing great product update ideas, and singing our praises to other potential customers. Thanks fam!<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Meticulous tracking<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not meticulously tracking and categorizing every customer service conversation, you\u2019re letting valuable data fall through the cracks. Our team creates a historical record of each conversation, which gives us a clear understanding and overview of what people are talking about, when, and why. It helps us easily see any common issues and gives us some insight into what we might be able to do about them. &nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as that, it self-trains our COs to think about how to quantify conversations\u2014which are generally thought of as inherently qualitative. Now, our CO\u2019s can look at a message and immediately they have tracked it in their head, they know what the appropriate response should be, and they\u2019ve mentally moved onto the next thing. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Fast response times<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/customer-service-benchmark-report\/\">The average response time<\/a> to handle a customer service request is 12 hours and 10 minutes. It goes without saying that customers want a response to their queries much faster than that. In our team, we\u2019re laser-focused on responding to our customers fast and providing solutions as quick as we can. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we do this with a much smaller team than many other companies with a user-base our size. Where other similar companies have 20 or more people on their customer support teams, our team is made up of just 4 people. Yep! With our humble team of 4, we manage to cover 200,000 members, 18-hours a day, with great response times, ratings and reviews. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons we\u2019re able to do this is the tracking system I already mentioned. Another is our carefully curated and updated self-service feature.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. A self-service feature <br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every good customer service team should have a constantly-evolving and robust \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/faq.and.co\/\">frequently asked questions<\/a>\u2019 or tutorial section that helps customers with common queries. As you scale, you start to see patterns in the questions you\u2019re asked, and you want to be able to direct people somewhere where they can find an in-depth answer. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make your self-service feature easy-to-find and easily searchable, you can even reduce the number of queries that come in in the first place. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the time you save on re-explaining the same functions can be put into ensuring the other aspects of your customer service team\u2014like fast response times and proactivity\u2014are up to scratch. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Proactivity <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is how new companies can differentiate themselves: GREAT <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/CustomerExperience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CustomerExperience<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andco<\/a> doing it right <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/lgWEt0Y3bP\">pic.twitter.com\/lgWEt0Y3bP<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Zac Heisey (@zac_heisey) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/zac_heisey\/status\/872579971121852416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 7, 2017<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Being proactive in customer service means resolving issues before they become problems, and finding extra ways to make customers feel valued and cared-for. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, most customer service teams don\u2019t get to the point where they can be proactive, because they\u2019re so bogged down with being reactive. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By creating the right procedures and habits, even a small team can carve out bandwidth everyday for the little things that make all the difference\u2014like writing handwritten letters or responding to praise on Twitter. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also use our proactive moments to reach out when we see something that might mean a user is struggling. For example, if they experienced a failed payment, we personally contact them to ask if they need help and suggest solutions (and of course we track how many members go on to convert after this interaction). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Good customer service is always evolving<br><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding the perfect mix of guidelines for your customer service team takes time, and there\u2019s always more that can be done. For that reason, an excellent customer service team will be constantly evolving, forever tracking their progress and looking for ways to improve. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Huge shoutout to <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@andco<\/a> for their awesome customer service!
