Not to mention, you spend more time chasing your money, rather than socking it away for the future. Sadly, this is the reality for a lot of freelancers<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014forever stuck on the pay schedules of clients. However, if a particular client is falling behind with unpaid invoices, there are a few steps you can take to nudge them along.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">If you&#8217;re struggling with keeping up with outstanding invoices, then here&#8217;s how you can remind your clients to pay them:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\">Understand Your Clients Pay Schedules<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"fr-style\">Now, before pursuing alternative routes to get paid from clients, your first step is to understand your clients&#8217; pay schedules.<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">Overall, this means knowing the typical turnaround for when they pay freelancers and then following that process. For example, many clients follow a pay policy called &#8220;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.apruve.com\/the-difference-between-net-30-and-due-in-30-days\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Net 30<\/span><\/a><span class=\"fr-style\">,&#8221; which means that an invoice will be paid 30 days after the invoice date. In some cases, that turnaround may be net 15, net 60, some clients may even pay you immediately once an invoice is received.\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">Unfortunately, clients have the right to change pay tables based on their normal payroll processes. However, as a vendor, you can lay out your payment terms before getting hired, and then work with your client to find a happy medium. That said, net 30 is a typical turnaround time to expect for freelance work.<\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\">So, for the sake of this article, imagine that your client follows a payment plan of net 30. You&#8217;ve already sent your invoice a month ago, and after checking your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/\">invoice tracker<\/a>, you still see that the bill is outstanding. Now you can follow up with an appropriate first response.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Always Start with a Polite Email<\/h2>\n<p>You never want to get angry with a client, so your best course of action to remind them to pay you is to always start with a polite email.<br \/>\nWhether it&#8217;s a new client or a long-time contact, after you send the invoice<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014and after a few days of no response (give them a bit of a grace period)<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014simply send them a short message that notifies them of the invoice&#8217;s presence.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Here&#8217;s an example you can use:<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">&#8220;Hey there (name),<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">I just want wanted to check in and let you know that I sent you an invoice for the assignments last month. Please let me know that you received it and when it can be processed.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Thank you again for the opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you.<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">-(your name)&#8221;<\/span><\/span><br \/>\nShort and sweet, right? More often than not, a basic email like this is all you&#8217;ll need to light a fire under them. And in some cases, you can resort to sending multiple emails<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014spaced a few days apart<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014until they respond to you with a resolution.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Email is a laidback, non-confrontational way to let a client know that you need to get paid. Sometimes, clients forget or invoices get lost in the shuffle of online mayhem. It&#8217;s best for you to be as patient as you can be, but if things continue to go unrecognized, you can take more serious action.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Make a Phone Call<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">There&#8217;s a chance that emails are falling on blind eyes, and if that&#8217;s the case for your invoices, then it may be time to make a phone call to the client.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><br \/>\nMany freelancers may be reluctant to talk to a client over the phone since a lot of communication happens online, but by making a phone call, you break down that barrier of distance that a lot of clients may rely on to skirt payments. Chances are, you&#8217;ll have your client&#8217;s contact information on file, so with that, find the number for their office or personal line, and give them a ring.<br \/>\nIn most cases, you won&#8217;t actually have to speak with them<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014many of these calls go straight to voicemail or to an assistant<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014but your only mission here is to leave a message with the same polite tone you had in your email. You can let them know that you&#8217;ve been trying to reach them, and that you would like for the invoice to be resolved right away. Remind them that you&#8217;ve sent the invoice over, and that if they have any issues, they can email you or call you for questions.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Even if they do answer the phone and you have the chance to speak with them, remain firm on your goals, but also maintain your composure as a professional, patient freelancer. Traditionally, getting paid as a freelancer takes time, so you can&#8217;t expect clients to compensate you in split seconds. However, you should always stick up for yourself and urge clients to pay you within the terms that they agree to<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014there&#8217;s no excuse for that.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">If All Else Fails, File a Claim or Take Legal Action<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">Finally, if a client doesn&#8217;t respond to emails or phone calls, your last resort is to file a claim or take legal action against them.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">As a courtesy<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014if you feel like it<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014you can send them a collection letter that states that if they don&#8217;t pay within a certain amount of time (which your invoice should already be outstanding by a substantial amount), you&#8217;re going to send the dispute over to a collections agency. Once again, in most cases, serious action like this will pressure them to pay up. On the other hand, if a collections letter also gets radio silence, you can file a claim with your state&#8217;s labor departments.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\n<span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">For instance, the Freelancer&#8217;s Union offers a great breakdown of\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">filing claims for client-nonpayment,<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\"><span class=\"fr-style\">\u00a0so be sure to explore what routes you can take to ensure that you get what&#8217;s owed to you. In some instances, you can even seek reparations for the income you&#8217;ve lost due to unpaid invoices, and be paid additional fees for pay periods that are neglected for long stretches of time.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><br \/>\nOf course, nobody wants to reach this point with a client, but you can rest assured that you have options out there to advocate for yourself, rather than taking a financial hit.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Track of Your Invoices with AND.CO<\/h2>\n<p>Most freelancers deal with issues on nonpayment because they lack the right support to track of invoices in the first place.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s no reason why your income should suffer due to lack of preparation or unresponsive clients, so to help thwart the setbacks, <a href=\"https:\/\/app.workspace.fiverr.com\/signup\">make sure to sign up for Fiverr Workspace<\/a>\u00a0You can easily create and send invoices for clients in seconds.
