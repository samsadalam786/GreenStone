I have a portfolio on Contently\/Dribble\u201d<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A freelance website is so much more than just a place to display the things you\u2019ve done. While a portfolio page may have it\u2019s place on a freelance website, your freelance website is mainly used to show your expertise in your niche.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most portfolios don&#8217;t have testimonials that allow you to share other great skills that you bring to the table like ease of working, your communication skills etc.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"niche\">Pick the right niche<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes made by most freelancers just starting out is trying to offer too many services and not niching into a specific market.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to target a specific market. \u201cThe riches are in the niches\u201d as they say.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my episode of the <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/jeremy-noronha\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Six Figure Freelancer Course (opens in a new tab)\">Six Figure Freelancer Course<\/a> this was one of my many takeaway quotes<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cDon&#8217;t be a WordPress developer. Be a WordPress developer that builds WordPress themes for blogger moms. Now you know who your audience is.\u201d<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, as a freelancer <strong>you shouldn\u2019t market yourself as a \u201cjob title\u201d<\/strong>, instead you should highlight that <strong>you do a specific task<\/strong> and your freelance website is your opportunity to highlight how you can solve the problem your customer has.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.elisedopson.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Elise Dopson (opens in a new tab)\">Elise Dopson<\/a> does this well, if you go to here website she markets herself as a \u201cFreelance Writer For SaaS and Ecommerce\u201d. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>She doesn\u2019t market herself as a <strong>\u201cWriter\u201d<\/strong>, instead she writes blog posts and white papers for B2B SaaS and marketing companies.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does this filter the people that contact her, but it shows her clients that she\u2019s focused on one topic and not trying to do everything.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big plus is that you can rank higher on Google if you target a specific niche. It\u2019s much easier to be on page #1 on Google for \u201cFreelance writer for SaaS\u201d than it is to be page #1 for \u201cFreelance Writer\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organic traffic from Google is <a aria-label=\"one of the best ways to generate leads (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/venngage.com\/blog\/lead-generation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one of the best ways to generate leads<\/a> on autopilot to your business website.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However unless you niche down and target a specific audience you won\u2019t be able to rank as the competition is extremely high, and even if you do rank high on Google for a search term like &#8220;Freelance writer&#8221; you will then have to filter through your leads to find the ones that are actually worth it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Most companies aren\u2019t looking to hire a <em>jack of all trades<\/em>, they\u2019re looking to hire <strong>specific specialists to solve specific problems<\/strong>.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Leverage Storytelling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing your story in the form of <a href=\"https:\/\/bid4papers.com\/blog\/narrative-essay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"narrative essay (opens in a new tab)\">narrative essay<\/a> can be a great way to build an audience on the Internet.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to understand your audience and what\u2019s their intent. <strong>A cafe doesn\u2019t want a website, it wants more people to visit the cafe.&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re building websites for small business, highlighting how you\u2019ve learned the latest Javascript framework is a waste of time.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlight how you increased leads for a former client or even to your own business thanks to a website.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Case Studies on your freelance website are one of the best ways to generate leads and close new clients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a great case study by Nat Elison on Growth Machine on how they took a site from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.growthmachine.com\/blog\/seo-case-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"0 to 150,000 Monthly Visitors in 8 Months (opens in a new tab)\">0 to 150,000 Monthly Visitors in 8 Months<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many businesses nowadays share a ton of case studies because they\u2019ve seen the benefits from them.

Your website should always be a work in progress, it\u2019s not possible to build the \u201cperfect freelance site\u201d, because there\u2019s no perfect website.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>The best freelance website that is one that gets you rolling and gets you clients.&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on making your website perfect is just another form of procrastination.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Set Up Your Freelance Website?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I would always recommend setting up your freelance site on a self hosted WordPress.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is that?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, for starters you have a proper website and not something like johnthewriter.blogspot.com. Also <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"WordPress (opens in a new tab)\">WordPress<\/a> (WordPress.org not WordPress.com) is an easy to use platform that can grow with you and your business.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to start an ecommerce store alongside your freelance website in the future, or run a blog to increase your audience? WordPress has you covered.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, almost all the websites examples in this article use WordPress.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also the platform with the greatest amount of tools, plugins and documentation available on the internet.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few other alternatives to WordPress that are pretty great too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Carrd (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/carrd.co\/\" target=\"_blank\">Carrd<\/a> is a great choice for aesthetically focused people who want to build a simple one page website.

Graphic design, photographers.<\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Webflow (opens in a new tab)\">Webflow<\/a> is a great choice for people who aren\u2019t very tech savvy and want things to work great out of the box.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a website on WordPress doesn\u2019t have to be hard, especially with an easy-to-use drag and drop theme. <strong><em>You don\u2019t need to learn any code to be able to build a website.&nbsp;<\/em><\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Pick a good domain name<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For many people their domain name is their firstnamelastname.com, like mine at <a href=\"https:\/\/jeremynoronha.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"JeremyNoronha.com (opens in a new tab)\">JeremyNoronha.com<\/a>. Now this is a great option,. However, if there&#8217;s a way to include your skill in the name, that\u2019s a great plus.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Pick a good host<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I would recommend <a href=\"https:\/\/siteground.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"SiteGround (opens in a new tab)\">SiteGround<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/siteground.com\"> <\/a>for this. They&#8217;re one of the top rated host and they also set up your WordPress site for free if you sign up for their plans.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ll be able to buy your domain name for an additional cost in the process.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Pick a good WordPress theme<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re many free WordPress themes out there, however I would recommend investing in a premium WordPress theme as they&#8217;re well structured and less likely to have errors.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Divi by Elegant Themes (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/jeremynoronha.com\/divi-elegant-theme-review\/\" target=\"_blank\">Divi by Elegant Themes<\/a> if you want an easy-to-use drag and drop builder or <a href=\"https:\/\/studiopress.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"StudioPress themes (opens in a new tab)\">StudioPress themes<\/a> if you like any of their designs.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There you have it! That&#8217;s all you need.&nbsp;<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to hire a developer to build a site, it&#8217;s something you could do over a weekend for about the monthly cost of a coffee or two.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting your freelance website is the easy part of this equation. I would recommend that you first spend time in the right niche and understanding the value you can bring to your clients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because at the end of the day, it\u2019s all about the results you can drive for your client.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All the best!<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tips to get started with your freelance website and how to grow it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":61,"featured_media":8341,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to build a freelance website that gets you clients<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Find actionnable tips on how to create your freelance website and make sure you grow rapidly.
