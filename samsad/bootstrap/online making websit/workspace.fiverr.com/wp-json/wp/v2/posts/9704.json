But receiving payment for those freelance jobs isn\u2019t as easy as acquiring the work because of various rules and regulations monitoring the international transfer of funds.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on what country a freelancer lives in and what country each client lives in, freelancers could be losing a large percentage of their profits simply by getting money sent through these services.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s the best money mover for your particular freelancing situation? Keep reading as we explore some of the major players in the industry and assess their strengths and weaknesses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Paypal<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve never heard of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paypal<\/a> before, it\u2019s likely that you\u2019re an alien visiting the earth several million years from now and you\u2019re reading this blog as part of an archeological expedition. Paypal\u2019s \u201cFees\u201d <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/us\/webapps\/mpp\/paypal-fees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> claims that \u201cPaypal\u2019s fees are always fair\u201d which is probably true if you own Paypal, but not as much for the rest of us. For international transactions, Paypal charges a 3.9% transaction fee \u201cplus a fixed fee based on currency received\u201d. Finding what that fee is can require a bit of detective work on your part to figure out just what that fee is for your particular country as well as that of your employer. From personal experience, I can tell you that it\u2019s a lot more than spare change you\u2019re losing. I live in the US and have a client in the UK who pays me in pounds via Paypal. Instead of the 2.5% I give up when dealing with a fellow American, I give away whopping 9.5% to Paypal for converting those pounds into my dollars. So for every $100 I make, nearly $10 of them stay right there in Paypal\u2019s deep pockets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>CurrencyFair<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Somewhat of a newcomer to the scene, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.currencyfair.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CurrencyFair<\/a>\u00a0aims to save you money during your exchanges. CurrencyFair involves the freelancer and client by matching their transaction in terms of currency to other people in the world seeking to send the reverse of that currency. Its QuickTrade option allows users to exchange funds at an average of 0.35% of the interbank rate, meaning that both client and freelancer could avoid major fee headaches that might make future collaboration a laborious task rather than a pleasant convenience. If you aren&#8217;t in a rush and are willing to wait for a potentially more favorable rate, the CurrencyFair <a href=\"https:\/\/www.currencyfair.com\/blog\/currencyfairs-marketplace-explained\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MarketPlace<\/a> might be right for you.<\/p>\n<p><b>AIB<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/personal.aib.ie\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AIB<\/a> is an Ireland-based firm that specializes in transactions made throughout the UK and Ireland, but offers rates to international clients as well. Once you move outside of the UK and into the EU, Canada, or the US, things get hairy in a hurry as AIB charges \u20ac22.50 per electronic transfer of funds. If you\u2019re an American or live and breathe American currency, that\u2019s a $24.81 coming out of your profit. Imagine doing a job for $25 for an overseas client who wants to pay you through AIB and seeing 19 cents added to your bank account. Talk about getting stiffed!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Western Union<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s hard to fault the reputation of a company with 165 years of history that used to bring goods and services to people via stagecoach. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westernunion.com\/us\/en\/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Western Union<\/a> is quite hit and miss with the countries it gives impressive discounts to versus the countries it taxes the heck out of for more distantly located ones. A rule of thumb &#8211; the bigger your population, the less you\u2019ll have to pay in fees.<\/span><br \/>\nWhen you\u2019re working for clients overseas, do your homework first when it comes to arranging payment. Most clients are willing to work with you on how the money is sent, especially if you\u2019re doing quality work for them, or you have the facts to back up that I\u2019ve yet to meet the client who wasn\u2019t willing to save a bit on overhead by trying something new. Do your research on where your client is sending the money from and find the best deal to fit all of your needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the best parts of being a freelancer is the true freedom to work from anywhere in the world for anyone in the world.
