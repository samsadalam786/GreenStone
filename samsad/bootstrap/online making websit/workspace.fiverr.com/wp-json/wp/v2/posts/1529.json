I wasn\u2019t always this disciplined. At the start of my solopreneur career, 10 or so years ago, I took a big leap, leaving a job I was miserable in, and facing the unknown with no plan and not enough cash to get me through the month. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u2019s what I wish I knew, and what I continue to refer back to, because while I believe this is applicable when you\u2019re just getting started, it\u2019s also serves as reminders to me when I get into the weeds of my solo business. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b> That grit IS the reason I\u2019m still going. <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While I wouldn\u2019t recommend to anyone to go solo without some savings, it did show me that it can be done. It\u2019s just a lot of hard work, stressful nights, and likely, the smell of desperation at a new client meeting. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recommendation: Have no fear, grit can be learned. Get to know where you\u2019re at. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/angeladuckworth.com\/grit-scale\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Test your grit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><b> Having savings for at least 3 months makes for a smart safety net, which means budgeting. <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It kind of sounds easy. Make a budget. Have a line item for savings. Balance budget and actuals. But this is one area of administration that has taken me the longest to develop a habit around. The other is taxes. Thankful annually for my awesome accountant!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recommendation: Budgeting and savings are skills, we aren\u2019t born with these abilities. Build a practice of budgeting at any time, it\u2019s never too late. You might surprise yourself at how quickly you can turn it into a weekly or monthly or quarterly habit! <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><b> Start building your clientele early, like before you quit your day job. <\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">What gave me the courage to quit the job I hated, was a former business acquaintance turned friend who said she\u2019d hire me to do some of her marketing. Sure, we had no formal agreement, but I had my first client the day I struck out on my own.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recommendation: If you have enough of #1 grit, you can fuel yourself through the moonlighting phase. Building a clientele takes time, but you\u2019re resourceful and have a network of people. Make a list of prospects. Connect and explore how you can help them. Ask for the sale. 90% grit. 10% pitch. <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><b> Get clear about what\u2019s really important in your freelance career.<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Being happy in the work I produce and working with incredible collaborators and clients and getting to work the way you want, is important, to me. It boils down to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">freedom<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which I further refined to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">choice<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. It&#8217;s easy to get sucked into other definitions of \u201cfreedom\u201d; slogans like Freedom 55 or work hard, play hard, and\/or work\/life balance are fine and dandy, but deciding if they are your definitions is of most importance. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recommendation: Sit down and define what is important to you and your lifestyle. Write it out. Put it somewhere you can see. Use it to guide your decisions. Ask yourself questions like \u201cDoes this client\/project align with my working style and\/or my personal values? <\/span><\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li><b> Create actionable and measurable business goals. Often.<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">They need not be groundbreaking. When I started out, I made vague statements that weren\u2019t tethered to what was actually achievable in the short term. But small and steady goals, that I measured over a month set a good pace for me, and gave me a sense of accomplishment.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Recommendation: Think of your to-do list, and increase your time horizons from daily to weekly. Need help? Get yourself a career coach or an accountability buddy. They both can help you stay on track! <\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Get more freelancer tips and check out solopreneur stories on the <\/span><\/i><a
