Yes, we can hear your collective groan from here.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s face it\u2014very few freelancers look forward to tax time. With so much number crunching, documentation, and a seemingly endless avalanche of paperwork involved, it\u2019s definitely enough to inspire headaches for all of us. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s always smart to connect with a professional who can help navigate\u00a0you through those murky tax waters. However, it\u2019s also a great benefit if you do some homework and gather some knowledge for yourself (plus, it\u2019ll save you the embarrassment of seeming totally out-of-the-loop when you <em>do<\/em> finally sit down with your CPA!).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get started, let\u2019s touch on something basic: the 1099 form. As a freelancer, you\u2019ll be on the receiving end of a lot of these. So, it\u2019s important that you understand their purpose, as well as how to deal with them correctly. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What is a 1099 Form?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chances are, you\u2019re familiar with this form already. But, if you\u2019ve ever wondered what exactly a 1099 form is\u2014without being sorely confused by all of that legal mumbo jumbo\u2014let\u2019s break it down simply:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you work a traditional job, you receive a W-2 from your employer. This form details your wage and salary information, as well as the amount you paid in state, federal, and other taxes throughout the year\u2014which were withheld directly from your paycheck. The IRS requires that this information be reported by employers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, when you\u2019re a freelancer, you obviously don\u2019t have just one employer to report on your income and your taxes paid. This is where the 1099 form comes into play.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This form (there are actually numerous different types\u2014more on that later!) is used to report other types of income, whether that\u2019s interest earned from a bank account or\u2014you guessed it\u2014money you earned through your freelance and consulting work. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cForm 1099s are one tool that the IRS uses to estimate total revenue paid to businesses,\u201d explains Rebecca Norris, CPA in a post on the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">JPMS Cox Accountants and Consultants<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> blog, \u201cThey can help the IRS to ensure that business owners do not underreport their earnings for income tax purposes. Filing a 1099 also provides supporting documentation for expenses deducted on the filer\u2019s tax returns.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Read more: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/what-is-a-1099-form-youre-gonna-learn-today\/\">What is a 1099 form?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">What You Need to Know About 1099 Forms<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alright, so now that you know that these forms actually serve an important purpose (and aren\u2019t just yet another cruel way for the IRS to make your life that much harder), what else do you need to know about them?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s touch on some things that you should make sure to keep in mind when dealing with your 1099 forms.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>1. You Need Them to Properly File<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ll start with the most obvious point first: You need these forms when filing your taxes. Any client who has paid you over $600 throughout the year owes you a 1099 form so that you can adequately report the income and pay taxes on it. And consider this your fair warning: While clients aren\u2019t required to submit a 1099 under that $600 threshold, you are still required to report the income (we know\u2014life\u2019s not fair). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Businesses are required to mail out these forms by January 31 for the previous calendar year, meaning you should have all of yours in hand by early February at the latest. Unfortunately, many businesses do still mail them late\u2014despite the penalties they face for doing so. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what happens if your client fails to send one to you at all? You might be tempted to reach out and request one. However, many experts warn against that tactic.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf you don&#8217;t receive a Form 1099 you expect, don&#8217;t ask for it,\u201d warns Robert Wood in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robertwood\/2015\/03\/31\/ten-things-you-should-know-about-irs-form-1099\/#622cb17feae6\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">his article for <em>Forbes<\/em><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cIf you call or write the payer and raise the issue, you may end up with two of them, one issued in the ordinary course (even if it never got to you), and one issued because you called.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can just add a whole additional layer of confusion to things. So, instead, you should just plan to still report the income\u2014whether you have a 1099 to reference or not.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. You Should Report All Income to Avoid Headaches (Even Without a 1099)<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That brings us right into our next point. You absolutely should report all of your income. Yes, even if it\u2019s under $600 and even if you didn\u2019t receive a 1099 form from that client.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why? Well, because that money is still taxable income that the IRS needs to know about. And, even further, it\u2019s the ethical thing to do as a freelancer.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, the clients who did pay you more than $600 throughout the year can find themselves in hot water if it\u2019s discovered that they failed to provide you with a 1099\u2014and you don\u2019t want to end up in that boiling boat with them. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, when in doubt, report every last penny you earn. Yes, it can hurt to have even more taxes taken out of your hard-earned paychecks. But, in the end, that honest approach will save you many more headaches than it causes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. You Should Request to Fix Any 1099 Errors<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You begin receiving your 1099 forms in the mail, and\u2014instead of opening them right away\u2014you toss them all into a pile on the corner of your desk to be dealt with later. While we can admire your somewhat organized method of keeping these all together, it\u2019s better if you take a couple of minutes to check over each document as you receive it to ensure that they\u2019re error-free. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, your clients aren\u2019t perfect\u2014they\u2019re bound to make mistakes here and there too. And, you\u2019d rather discover now that your last name is spelled wrong or your address is incorrect (when you still have time to fix it!) than the night before you\u2019re due to submit everything.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, yes, you absolutely should request that your client fix any errors on your 1099 form. If the client hasn\u2019t already submitted the form to the IRS, they should be able to make the change, destroy the incorrect form, and then send in the correct one.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if the client has already submitted the incorrect form, they\u2019ll need to go through the steps to correct it with the IRS\u2014which typically involves the simple step of preparing a new form and checking the box marked \u201cCORRECTED\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Your Social Security Number Holds the Key<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the above is undoubtedly important and you should make it your goal to ensure that each piece of information on your 1099 form is correct, here\u2019s the most crucial thing to remember: It\u2019s all tied to your social security number, making that the most critical piece of information on these forms (so, yes, quadruple-check that on every single form you receive!).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYour name and address are important, but Forms 1099 are really controlled by your Social Security number,\u201d explains Robert Wood in a separate piece <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/robertwood\/2016\/01\/20\/irs-forms-1099-are-coming-the-most-important-tax-form-of-all\/#7308799e5310\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">he authored for <em>Forbes<\/em><\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201cEven if an issuer has your <\/span><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">old<\/span><\/em> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">address<\/span><\/em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the information will be reported to the IRS (and your state tax authority) based on your Social Security number.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the bottom line? Make sure those digits are correct. They\u2019re important!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. You Should Have the Correct Type of Form<\/strong><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that there is a huge variety when it comes to 1099 forms? That\u2019s right\u2014there\u2019s a whole assortment to choose from.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, don\u2019t start breathing into a paper bag quite yet thinking that now you have to sift through even more impossible-to-read requirements in an attempt to figure out which exact form you\u2019re supposed to receive. We\u2019ll make this easy on you: Freelancers should receive Form 1099-MISC from clients, which is the one used to report miscellaneous income.<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.efile.com\/what-is-form-1099-misc-income-tax-return-requirements\/#types-requirements-due-dates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other 1099 forms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> include 1099-C, which is used to report the cancellation of debt, and even 1099-S, which details payments from real estate transactions\u2014among many, many other types of 1099 forms. But, as a freelancer, you only need to be concerned with 1099-MISC.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a client somehow gets confused and sends you a different type of 1099? You\u2019ll want to ask to have that corrected.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Wrapping 1099s Up<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s be honest\u2014no freelancer is ever going to bust into his or her happy dance at the thought or mention of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taxes<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The process is taxing at best (yes, pun very much intended).<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With seemingly endless confusion, paperwork, and painful quarterly payments (by the way, we have a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/quarterly-tax-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">handy Quarterly Tax Calculator Bot<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to help with that!), managing your taxes as a freelancer is enough to inspire you to just lay your head down on your desk until it all magically goes away.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, as you know, that isn\u2019t exactly the smartest tactic. Instead, it\u2019s best to get informed, stay organized, and tackle your taxes head on. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, when in doubt, don\u2019t hesitate to enlist the help of a tax professional to guide you through it. Yes, it\u2019ll require a little bit of money out of your pocket. But, the blood, sweat, and tears it saves you will be more than worth it. Plus, the best part? The cost of that appointment is a tax deduction for you! We call that a freelance win. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><!--vcv no format--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Taxes.
