And opportunities to collaborate are endless.<br \/>\nIn this article, 14 Pro-level freelancers will share how collaborations have helped them <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/how-two-freelance-writers-networked-their-way-to-success\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">grow their networks<\/span><\/a> and skyrocket their revenue.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Focus On the Business\u2014Not Just the Daily Work<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the biggest benefits of collaborating with other freelancers is that it frees you up, as a business owner, to focus on the big picture of your business instead of the daily work.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy entire business is built through collaborations,\u201d explains Preston Lee at <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Millo, a blog for freelancers<\/span><\/a>. \u201cWhen I first started, I did everything the business needed, but over time, I\u2019ve built a small but powerful team of freelancers.<br \/>\n\u201cThis not only frees me up to find a good work-life balancer, but also helps me focus on how to grow the business sustainably, instead of getting bogged down by the daily and weekly tasks that used to clog up my calendar.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating is a great way to keep your business moving forward even when you have a major project to take on.<br \/>\nLogo designer Ian Paget is in the midst redesigning <a href=\"https:\/\/logogeek.uk\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">his logo design website<\/span><\/a>. \u201cTo help speed up the process,\u201d he explained, \u201cI\u2019ve hired a freelance web designer friend to help. This saves me having to learn new skills, which makes the website better and allows me to focus my time and energy into the parts of my business that make money.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Blogger Hao from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.balancethegrind.com.au\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Balance the Grind<\/span><\/a> shared something similar. \u201cFiverr has been a great platform for me to outsource tasks. That way, I can focus on the bigger picture.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>If you find yourself constantly too busy working in your business to work on your business, then it may be time to focus on collaborations that can free you up to focus on what matters most in your business.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Build Long-Term Partnerships &amp; Friendships<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>When you focus on collaborations in your freelance business, you\u2019ll find you develop long-term partnerships and friendships.<\/p>\n<p>Partnerships help your business grow over the long-term and friendships help keep you sane and accountable.<br \/>\nEntrepreneur <a href=\"https:\/\/Jake-Jorgovan.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jake Jorgovan<\/span><\/a> explained to me how important collaborations have been to his business over the years. \u201cCollaborations are essential to my business,\u201d he assured. \u201cOften those relationships form into friendships and partnerships for year after year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Ian agrees. \u201cAfter attending an event 2 years ago I made friends with a group of other freelancers \u2026 and we decided to start a mastermind group. We meet every 2 months to remain motivated and inspired, but more importantly, it\u2019s provided some much needed accountability to ensure we all achieve our goals.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Get More Done &amp; Scale Your Business<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Of course, one natural side-effect in working with other freelancers is your business can get more done and scale as a result.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs a content creator, there is no shortage of work to be done!\u201d podcaster <a href=\"https:\/\/freelancing.school\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Jay Clouse<\/span><\/a> says.<br \/>\n\u201cI have a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/4-tips-for-managing-a-remote-team-of-freelance-designers\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">small team of freelancers<\/span><\/a> who help with illustrations, transcripts, and audio engineering for my podcast. They save me hours each week and help me to create a much stronger finished product.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lacroixcreative.com\/\">Patricia LaCroix<\/a><\/span> agrees. \u201cI work at home, and I enjoy staying small in size, but I still want to be big in profits.<br \/>\n\u201cI&#8217;ve found that using freelancers saves me money on things like benefits and supplies, while giving me the space to be able to add more projects and scale up with existing clients.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Logo designer <a href=\"https:\/\/benbrushdesign.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben Brush<\/span><\/a> scales his business up and down with each project he takes on. \u201c A strong network of freelancers covering a variety of skills,\u201d he explains, \u201callows you to scale up and down to match the scope of every project.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Collaborating with other freelancers also allows you to hand-off work you\u2019re not as talented at or simply don\u2019t enjoy doing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI know where I\u2019m good at, but I\u2019m also aware of my weak points or what I don\u2019t like to do,\u201d says freelancer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designmania.gr\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Mania Mavridou<\/span><\/a>. \u201cSo, the perfect match is someone who does better, what I do badly!\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Amplify Your Reach and Referrals<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/BusinessBitch.com\">Chelsea Baldwin<\/a><\/span> has grown multiple businesses doing work she loves\u2014but she hasn\u2019t done it completely alone.<br \/>\n\u201cThe best thing I ever did for my freelance career,\u201d she told me, \u201cwas to start reaching out to other freelancers who were my \u2018competition\u2019 to just say hi and start friendly relationships.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOver time, some of these relationships have resulted in referrals, but a lot of them have led to partnerships and connections that have helped me expand my reach and grow my audience.\u201d<br \/>\nBecause \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d marketing continues to be one of the most common ways <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/how-to-get-freelance-clients\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">freelancers find new clients<\/span><\/a>, collaborating with partners who can send you referrals is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>Freelancer-turned-entrepreneur <a href=\"https:\/\/getdripify.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Clay Mosley<\/span><\/a> explains: &#8220;Having strategic relationships allows you to skip the constant transactional business and skip chasing prospects left and right,\u201d Clay says.<br \/>\n\u201cIf you collaborate with other people or businesses that share the same target market as your business, you can send (and receive) a constant flow of referrals.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you can develop five of these partnerships, you will have endless referrals.\u201d<br \/>\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/rhondapage.com\/\">Rhonda Page<\/a><\/span>\u2019s entire business started as one big collaboration. \u201cI found a Linkedin group that had a large number of people in my target audience. I contacted the group leader and asked if he would like to collaborate. He invited the group to my webinar and 900 people attended! I built a list of 900 people in one day.\u201d<br \/>\nGraphic designer <a href=\"https:\/\/sumackloft.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Auni Milne<\/span><\/a> frequently collaborates with freelancers and other businesses in her community\u2014even choosing to do pro bono work at times.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese projects may not bring in much or any money, but they get great exposure in the community, and they help strengthen my brand and reputation.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Broaden Your Client Offering<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One way to use collaborations as a way to grow your revenue is by finding creative ways to offer clients services you may not be able to offer on your own.<br \/>\n\u201cIn order to provide more to my clients,\u201d says freelancer <a href=\"https:\/\/adamwrightdesign.com\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Adam Wright<\/span><\/a>, \u201cI have a select few colleagues to work with me on services out of my expertise, and vice-versa. Having these relationships helps me expand what I can offer and also increase my workload.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After 10 years of freelancing completely solo, <a href=\"https:\/\/mattolpinski.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Matt Olpinski<\/span><\/a> harnessed the power of collaborations to build something much bigger than he could have on his own.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI started my own web design and development company after 10 years of freelancing,\u201d he explains.<br \/>\n\u201cThat growth required me to begin delegating. Now I collaborate with other freelancers on larger projects and tasks that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to handle myself!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Auni agrees. \u201cI also have a very good friend who is a graphic designer as well. Since her design sensibility is quite different from mine, we sometimes collaborate on projects in order to show a more contrasting set of concepts.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>Collaborations Lead to All Kinds of Opportunity<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>As\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.benlcollins.com\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ben Collins<\/span><\/a>\u00a0said, \u201cYou get so many benefits from partnerships, including inspiration, motivation, advice, exposure to a new audience and perhaps affiliate revenue.\u201d<br \/>\nBen\u2019s right. If there\u2019s anything you can learn from these 14 pro freelancers it\u2019s that now is the time to level-up your collaboration game. Just because you work alone doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/how-to-network-when-you-work-from-home\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">constantly be networking from home<\/span><\/a>.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re not collaborating with fellow freelancers, sub-contractors, businesses in your community and others, you\u2019re missing out.<\/p>\n<p>There are always a million reasons <em>not<\/em> to reach out to other people. Maybe you feel too busy or too shy.<br \/>\nIf you feel too busy to network and collaborate, you need to start freeing up some of your time by using smart invoicing, planning, and project management tools (like\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\">AND.CO<\/a>).<br \/>\nIf you&#8217;re too much of an introvert, take it slow with small moments of bravery every week. Then invest in collaborations twice or three times a week. Then every day. Bit by bit, you&#8217;ll get used to it.<br \/>\nMake a goal to collaborate more and soon you\u2019ll find you\u2019re building long-term relationships, getting referrals, staying accountable, and growing your revenue.<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For many freelancers, the dream of working for yourself is exhilarating.
