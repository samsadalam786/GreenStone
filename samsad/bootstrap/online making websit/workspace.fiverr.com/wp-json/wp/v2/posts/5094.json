After all, if someone was fully aware of the pain that comes with working for yourself, I doubt so many people would actually do it. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fdo-you-want-to-freelance-over-a-decade%2F&#038;text=When%20getting%20started%20with%20freelancing%2C%20a%20certain%20reckless%20abandon%20helps.%20After%20all%2C%20if%20someone%20was%20fully%20aware%20of%20the%20pain%20that%20comes%20with%20working%20for%20yourself%2C%20I%20doubt%20so%20many%20people%20would%20actually%20do%20it.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nIt takes a lot to stomach the uncertainty and instability that inevitably comes from operating as a one-person army.<br \/>\nNot only are you responsible for doing the actual work of designing, developing, or writing, you are also the hunter-gatherer, the marketer, the project manager, the accountant, and pretty much anything else that needs to get done.<br \/>\nSo why did I decide to put myself through this?<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"cfde\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I have the&nbsp;<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">audacity<\/strong>&nbsp;to think that I can do it better than&nbsp;others.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"933d\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">Don\u2019t get me wrong. When I use the word \u201cbetter,\u201d I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m more talented than everyone else out there. In fact, I have plenty of friends who run circles around me when it comes to designing, writing, and most other hard skills.<\/p>\n<p id=\"cb7e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In my opinion, I seem to care more than most. I strive to treat my clients like real human beings with real problems. As a freelancer, your goal is to be as helpful as possible. In other words, you need to provide more value than your competition.<\/p>\n<p id=\"6c4f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">How else do you think freelancers compete with larger agencies? I have always positioned myself as someone who can solve problems faster than anyone else while also providing a one-on-one, quality experience.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"e3e3\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I am&nbsp;<strong class=\"markup--strong markup--h4-strong\">curious enough&nbsp;<\/strong>to solve real problems.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"80f9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There are plenty of designers who can design a logo. There are countless writers who can help you share your story. You can\u2019t throw a digital rock online without hitting someone who can get the job done.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c63f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The ones who are worth their salt will be curious enough to dig deeper and provide more value by addressing&nbsp;<em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">real<\/em>&nbsp;problems.<\/p>\n<p id=\"d4d7\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I can\u2019t tell you how many times someone has come to me assuming they need a brand or a website, only to learn they have more fundamental problems with their products, services, or operations.<\/p>\n<p id=\"0b90\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In order to peel back the layers. I ask more thoughtful questions. I poke and prod. Instead of giving the client what they want, my goal is to give them what they need. I ruthlessly aim to find the truth.<\/p>\n<p id=\"237f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You won\u2019t find this penetrating attention to detail from some no-name virtual worker online.&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other\" data-creator-ids=\"anon\">Approaching your industry from a more holistic perspective will set you apart from everyone else out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 id=\"fcf0\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I balance being patience with being proactive.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"4760\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">There are plenty of people who dabble with freelancing. Usually, they find themselves unemployed and anxious to temporarily fill the gap.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c6fb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">There\u2019s nothing wrong with this.<\/p>\n<p id=\"e792\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, if you want to turn freelancing into a sustainable career, you have to think much more long-term.<\/p>\n<p id=\"2178\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Just like with investing in the stock market, working for yourself has the inevitable ups and downs. If you\u2019ve slacked off on marketing, there will be weeks or months without work. You have to be able to make it through these rough patches without giving up.<\/p>\n<p id=\"78ca\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">During these dry spells, I make sure to create my own opportunity when there isn\u2019t any. This means being proactive.<\/p>\n<p id=\"8a2c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Whether it\u2019s updating some part of my personal brand or reaching out to others who might need my help, no action is too small to make a difference.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"86ef\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p\">I value my time over anything&nbsp;else.<\/h3>\n<p id=\"4524\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h4\">It\u2019s no secret that freelancing is hard. There are some days when your inbox is overflowing with potential leads, and then there are others when it\u2019s filled with tumbleweeds. No one seems to be picking up what you\u2019re putting down.<\/p>\n<p id=\"c687\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Even though these days can be extremely tough, I wouldn\u2019t trade them for the world. These are the valleys that make me appreciate the peaks of freelancing even more.<\/p>\n<p id=\"1877\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">They remind me that, even though this path is hard, I am in control of something much more valuable than money:<\/p>\n<p id=\"03bb\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><strong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Time.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2014 I still have a long way to go. I\u2019m nowhere near where I want to be, both financially or professionally. Because I have chosen to do things the \u201chard way,\u201d I have sacrificed immediate stability for the chance to create my own future.<br \/>\nAs romantic as this sounds, it\u2019s not glamorous.<br \/>\nI\u2019ve gone months without healthcare. I\u2019ve sacrificed relationships in order to prioritize my professional life. I\u2019ve knowingly shot my resum\u00e9 to hell all for the sake of productive fumbling.<\/p>\n<h3>I am constantly improving my discipline.<\/h3>\n<p>Why go through all of the struggle that comes with freelancing?<br \/>\nAlong with my time, I am able to reclaim my freedom. I\u2019m not obligated to chain myself to a desk for eight hours a day doing something I care nothing about.<br \/>\nI can work whenever I want, from wherever I want, with whomever I want.<br \/>\nJust because I have this freedom doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t have responsibility. In fact, I would argue that, as a freelancer, you have more responsibility than in a 9-to-5 position.<br \/>\nAs I mentioned before, you are responsible for juggling a lot of different tasks. Without extreme focus and daily discipline, it\u2019s easy to drop the ball and shoot yourself in the foot.<br \/>\nThis is why my life changed as soon as I created my own daily routine.<br \/>\nOver the span of months, I introduced tasks like reading, writing, and others into my morning routine using short, 30-minute periods. Thanks to these \u201cmicro-habits,\u201d I\u2019ve been able to build and sustain a routine that provides even more discipline every day.<\/p>\n<h3>I share my story early and often.<\/h3>\n<p>As much as we all enjoy talking about ourselves to our friends, it doesn\u2019t come second nature in our professional lives.<br \/>\nA major part of freelancing is getting over this insecurity and sharing what you\u2019re doing with others. Some call this \u201cself-promotion,\u201d others call it \u201cmarketing.\u201d<br \/>\nWhatever you call it, get used to doing it.<br \/>\nThree years ago, I started writing (almost) every day and it was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.<br \/>\nSharing my writing with others has allowed me to develop my own voice and share my story with others, all while remaining authentic and true to myself.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<p id=\"9de0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Hopefully, these traits have given you some idea of what it takes to freelance over the long haul. As I mentioned, it\u2019s not easy and it\u2019s not for everyone.<\/p>\n<p id=\"32d8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">However, if you can relate to the above points, then you might just have what it takes to make it.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"e9c6\" class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Either way, don\u2019t forget to share your story with others who need&nbsp;it.<\/h3>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Photo credit:&nbsp;Pexels This Is What It Takes to Make&nbsp;It When most people hear the word \u201cfreelancer,\u201d they probably picture a young, artsy twenty-something who is free<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":41,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Do You Want to Freelance Over A Decade?<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"It takes a lot to stomach the instability that inevitably comes from operating as a freelancer.
