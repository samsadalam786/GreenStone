One of the not-nice things about freelancing is that invoicing, organizing, and following-up on jobs can eat up a lot of that free time. Thankfully Fiverr Workspace is here to streamline those time-sucking chores and give you back your hard-earned minutes. As a new Fiverr Workspace user, you will find yourself with more free time than you know what to do with. Below are a few useful suggestions for filling those sweet, sweet hours of freedom.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Freelancers, Conquer the Mother of All Puzzles<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look, you\u2019re going to have a lot of time on your hands. You might literally run out of practical, useful things to do. When that happens, there\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Wildlife-33-600-Educa-Puzzle\/dp\/B00IA3HH5K\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this puzzle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It\u2019s titled <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wildlife<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and one can only assume that is because it depicts every single animal currently known to man and probably a few unknown to man.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an absurd 33,600 pieces, it\u2019s less a jigsaw and more a punishment of man\u2019s hubris sent down from Mt. Olympus. More amazingly than that, all of the animals featured in this puzzle\u2013from the majestic lions to the humble sloth to the bizarrely out-of-proportion crocodile\u2013are pretty much just hanging out chilling by a waterfall, not killing each other like they do in real life <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pretty much constantly<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Is it because the soft, healing light of some benevolent god is shining upon them? Or is it perhaps because in this depiction, humankind has obviously been extinct for centuries (Sun blocked out by a critical mass of vape shops, most likely). Seriously, no pollution? No factory farms? A Black Rhino still in possession of its horn? There is no chance humanity still exists in the future predicted by this puzzle.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What other secrets might it hold? Well for one, it foretells that you\u2019ll soon be moving to a new apartment. At a completed size of 19ft x 5ft, there\u2019s no way this bad boy is fitting in your studio, good thing you\u2019re making so much more freelancing than you were at your office job. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Embark on a Literary Saga&#8230;While Learning a New Language <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing nicer than some leisurely reading for killing time. What about when you\u2019ve got a lot of time to kill? Easy\u2013do <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lot<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of reading. If you\u2019re looking for volume (and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">volumes<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), Japanese author Kaoru Kurimoto\u2019s <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guin Saga<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a good place to start. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More precisely, book one of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guin Saga<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Guin-Saga-Book-Leopard-Paperback\/dp\/1932234810\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Leopard Mask<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) is a good place to start\u2013then you can begin chipping away at the other 129 installments. While that might sound like a laborious task, keep in mind we are talking about a story about \u00a0\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a mysterious\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">warrior<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0named Guin, an\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">amnesiac<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0with a\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">leopard<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0mask magically affixed to his head (above).\u201d Six words: Leopard. Mask. Magically. Affixed. To. Head. Somebody apparently wrote 130 books about King from Tekken? And for some reason George R.R. Martin can barely squeeze out five in twenty years?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a good thing that Fiverr Workspace will free up unprecedented amounts of free time, because one small detail I forgot to mention is that only the first five novels have been translated into English. So start your Japanese lessons now, because around the time Guin starts battling the Ape people, you\u2019re going to have a hard time putting these things down. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oh, and if you\u2019re still hankering for more Guin after finishing book 130 (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Fathomless Future<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">), there are another 22 \u201cside novels\u201d to go along with the series. Eat your heart out, Tolkien.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Achieve Transcendence, Avoid Teens <\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have had time for the gym before you discovered Fiverr Workspace but you probably didn\u2019t have time to train for a marathon, and you certainly didn\u2019t have time to run the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/3100.srichinmoyraces.org\/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-Transcendence Footrace<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The brainchild (or possibly sick prank) of Indian spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy, the race takes place over 52 days, covers 3,100 miles and is entirely limited to a single block in Jamaica, Queens. You read that correctly, participants in the race must complete an ungodly 5,649 laps around a block between 168<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Street and 164<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For reference, if you were instead to somehow run from Jamaica, Queens to Kingston, Jamaica, you\u2019d only have to cover about half that distance. For further reference, if you walked around that block once a day for fifteen years, you\u2019d still have 171 more days of walking left before you completed this insanity (accounting for three leap years). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intention was to create an opportunity for runners to \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discover the limits of their capacities and to try to go beyond them\u201d; apparently teaching the lesson that beyond the limits of our capacities lies a world of chaffed nipples and destroyed knee cartilage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps most grueling of all, the block that the Self-Transcendence Footrace circles is home to Edison High School. This means you can look forward to the same high school kids heckling you day after torturous day as your legs gradually turn to jelly and eventually you forget to avoid that pile of dog logs on 168<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> street because life is a pale illusion and you are the same as the street and the poop and the high-schoolers and the entire universe is just a single block in Queens and soon all the pain and noise and searing heat blends together into a single deafening hum and&#8230;hey, maybe they\u2019re onto something with transcendence thing.<\/span><br \/>\nThankfully with the time that Fiverr Workspace saves you, you\u2019ll be able to join the other competitors in somehow abandoning all earthly responsibilities for 52 straight days.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Play a Board Game the Size of North Africa<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Board games are a blast, but anybody who had a traumatic Monopoly experience as a child can tell you that they can be a bit lengthy. But now that Fiverr Workspace is making invoicing a snap, why not round up a few friends and while the day away in a contest of wit and skill.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, you\u2019ll have so much time once you start using AND CO, you might as well try out <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SPI-Campaign-Africa-Desert-1940-43\/dp\/B00NM7OB1W\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campaign for North Africa: The Desert War 1940-43<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This \u201cwar game like no other\u201d is suggested for ages 14 and up, requires 8-10 players and has an average play-time of 60,000 minutes, or roughly 42 days of non-stop play (with time to sleep, eat and breathe factored in, it\u2019s closer to 62 days). The map that the game is divided into thousands of hexagons onto which counters representing planes, pilots, supplies and everything down to individual foot soldiers are placed. Each player on a team plays a different role, including one who\u2019s sole job is to be \u201cin charge of all supplies\u201d\u2013ah, finally board game geeks can experience the simple joy that football players have known for ages: bullying the \u201cequipment manager.\u201d The game\u2019s handbook describes it as a \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">logistically-oriented game, and its play requires not only a lot of attention to logistics, but, if you will, a logistically sound methodology.\u201dJust in case you had mistaken it for something that could possibly be fun.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a game of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clue<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> required you to properly collect and store evidence, take statements from witnesses, file a police report, select a jury, and spend months negotiating with the defense for a settlement, it might still be more enjoyable and less time-consuming than <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campaign for North Africa<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Still the ultimate Achilles heel in the design of the game is thus; if you are the type of person who wants to play <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Campaign for North Africa<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you are most likely not the type of person who has seven friends to play it with *<\/span><b>sigh*<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> looks like Solitaire again\u2026<\/span><br \/>\nBut hey, at least you have the option thanks to your time saved using AND CO.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>One of the nice things about freelancing is that you get to make your own schedule, which means less hours of staring blankly at a computer<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":13,"featured_media":7587,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Fiverr Workspace Saves Freelancers Time So They Can Tackle Crazy Hobbies<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"As a new Fiverr Workspace user, you will find yourself with more free time.
