We must work from home, which makes slacking off a lot easier. Unfortunately, that can hurt performance, lead to poor results and sabotage your career.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll look at the 10 time blocking ways to supercharge your productivity and stay on top of your game.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What Is Time Blocking?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Time blocking is scheduling your work into smaller chunks &#8211; time blocks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using this approach will allow you to get an outline of your day, keep you on track, and lead to higher productivity. It takes away all the guesswork and thinking about what tasks you should do next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"301\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/6ws8nVnNu0UQYti77bXV5O6OihTlGSpYPT_dtE6Osnj9xTVx7M7eRyyh-499zYc5hOLMsh9YC1XZIinee683uSeE_iCOgCfIN5Xp4hiGEdgySowd3nFj_L9vPPO74zx3sGK9X_GI\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way, you focus only on the things that matter and waste no time. No wonder it&#8217;s used by the most successful people like Elon Musk and Bill Gates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives you better clarity, minimizes distractions, and creates a sense of control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s now discover actionable steps you can take to implement it into your workflow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#1 Outline What Tasks Need to Be Done<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Planning beforehand will save you lots of headaches and make the execution of time blocking a lot easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visualize your usual workday and write down all the tasks you do regularly. Your list can look like the one below:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Replying to emails<\/li><li>Reaching out to other businesses<\/li><li>Creating blog posts<\/li><li>Promoting blog posts on social media<\/li><li>Team meetings<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>After you got all of that listed out, it&#8217;s time to include other less important tasks you do every day, like commuting to work or eating.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have that, it&#8217;s time to divide it into shallow and deep work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#2 Understand Shallow &amp; Deep Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to time blocking, there are two types of tasks you can do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deep work is highly focused on tasks that help you move to your goals and directly impact your business&#8217;s success. If you are a marketer, this can include CRM, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engagebay.com\/marketing\/marketing-automation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">marketing automation<\/a>, and producing content.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shallow work focuses on tasks that are urgent but not important. This includes things such as responding to emails and communicating with your team.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/fSnHyMg5shQKvy0IXoJMD5ejvKLThhG3XN54-l7qcTuMJXDyb1FZVgEdFW6Q7DXhs8Jm2yQ_URyajmIKkPy3hU508TuQgbgFaFrHHrxxqp0WIwgJEDq_SOQM9FJHD3DxHIZ-COkW\" width=\"602\" height=\"360\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at your schedule, you should make sure you spend most of your time on deep work and devote only a tiny portion of your time to shallow work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do a lot of shallow work, don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll look at ways to minimize it later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#3 Estimate the Time It Takes to Finish<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just because you want to look clean and professional, doesn\u2019t mean you have to use the same\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">freelance proposal template<\/a>\u00a0every time with zero changes.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few ways you could consider customizing the look of your proposal while still keeping it professional:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Adjust colors to match your brand or your client\u2019s brand.<\/li><li>Add your client\u2019s logo next to yours for a more personalized approach.<\/li><li>Start with a custom salutation and name-drop of your client contact.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Focus on pain-points with matching solutions.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Estimating the time each task takes can be very difficult, especially in the beginning. An easy way to figure it out is to use remote work software with time tracking.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works similarly to a stopwatch and will let you know how much time you spend working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/QaHXS5zZ5o3JMQtVLIkcrGX4v1yApn-npAotw0Sypk8e6C3d2ru8Nooviluf40toKHFQ3d3XYxC8NTTe4RZK3kTmHsRoHDUMGs2191qfyb2AZX-cnHVKTgpIQtrpiMyPeM_c2fiI\" width=\"602\" height=\"343\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of the best ways to estimate the time each task takes. (<a href=\"https:\/\/colinshipp.com\/remote-work-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here are a few<\/a> of the best solutions.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also make sure that you add a little bit more time than the time the actual task takes. This is to prevent disrupting your time blocks because of surprises and unexpected things that can come up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will also prevent you from being stressed because of a lack of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>#4 Create a Schedule<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You have a list of tasks, and you&#8217;ve assigned a time to each one of them. You should now add them to your calendar and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/getting-your-schedule-under-control-as-a-freelancer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">create a schedule<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, it would be best if you started with the most important tasks as soon as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because you have the most energy in the morning, and your willpower is at its peak.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"590\" height=\"368\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/J6u31PcGyNNz7m19GQpaEhN2RIxIIqarMk2Dbt8pWb-ZvB6s_e-k7RCxuNRZ7pc2Cy7btAERaRm1i-EQ03cuWqCGUsrqzm2daH78XP7Q0iF21fA3Qlkx-51PsSsByeQj4e1A8UoB\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, some tasks have a fixed place like lunch or breakfast &#8211; you won&#8217;t be eating lunch at 5 o&#8217;clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the basic Calendar app for scheduling or choose other time blocking apps.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 class=\"has-large-font-size\">#5 Outsource Unimportant Tasks<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Examine your schedule and spot unimportant tasks that only take your time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you identify them, you should answer one simple question &#8211; &#8220;Is it worth my time?&#8221; And if your answer is no, you should outsource them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"301\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/MgTJbHvaA0Ot5MJXzMighMndy8_n4ibnG-peX_mc9EZJN8d5OZKL4LcL1YSE_R-mZbgNq0NnkhzTVDYg5rBNYEeNh2cmz26Li4991QvhYwfIB0m0d2Yxg13Pn_rZYHR5YdOZKWvg\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, let&#8217;s say that creating social media posts, responding to comments, and promoting posts takes you around 5 hours a week. That is a lot of time you could use on more important things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you should outsource these tasks to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/categories\/online-marketing\/social-marketing?source=category_tree\">social media manager<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>It will save you time and help you focus on the things that matter.

Make sure to reward yourself for your hard work with a break after each time block.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be long. It can take anywhere from 10 &#8211; 20 minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"287\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/paOczINkoOZb-Sg7NIRwTEWWx4rbZ5xOx8tO0VDZIdzxKDyMehKFjrG9Q5UspaquoejLl4rZV-7HOl32Adf9ahFKl9J5p1ZfxMkavm3P-9E7fX-7qfXcLIL8s-9oQkWhAGkOGU0K\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking breaks will help you stay on track, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/get-motivated-reach-freelance-potential\/\">have better motivation<\/a>, and feel less tired. Just make sure you don&#8217;t rest for too long, or you risk resting more than working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-210a3f9b-09a0-4a82-a723-bfd7b661174c\">#7 Utilize Pomodoros<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You shouldn&#8217;t take breaks only after time blocks but also during them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a marketer creating a sales funnel. This can be very tricky because you have to create your buyer&#8217;s persona, use the right <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freedomtoascend.com\/tools\/clickfunnels-alternatives\/\">funnel software solution<\/a> to build up the landing page, and optimize it to get as many sales as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"204\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/8gl9rCz2pojqrWHFcO9ZNgftrFN7TQWR4Cjs6RdO3OYmztdMWrh2tKJsF55Q0wb9Vql9v3X_l5ajo8VCwGRhL--D3lDe6KNUwxLvPZIVzkpe_Ieh7tYhJoEoJtZGQFhHEZvlvYu0\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But working on it a whole day non-stop is very ineffective. It&#8217;s a lot better to use Pomodoro.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pomodoro is a method for keeping you as productive as possible by dividing your work into smaller, 25-minute chunks. After each session, you have a 5-minute break, and then you continue working.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"339\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/yV3Y2fy6coQZnDdGFZ-2kL8pl1sWAIEpm9TNnP0XxbG0Oaocqn_PhcNxI1DWKCCIKgHDZmc7HVYXPK6jOGOyifwh971zR5l5Mr5sK3XI-hSFxZF0sBk8B8a8N3BrraG0fjVbooW2\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This makes you work on 120% because you are the most focused while working. And after you lose your focus after 25 minutes, you have a break where you recharge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"540\" height=\"400\" src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/BFobSqqemKoJ2UGr1t5J9s2-jL7ZICQP1ZDSiFgeUI5PXUJHkSWfjyQAMYHMJoiYYcFtAEsYzhwSvI8uFQFOuWWhaWt2_oOuUsdqZmRaOC1eY2Fd1uTjj4v6poehwVGji98Ia1hZ\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a small addition to time blocking that can make a big difference. For instance, if you have a time block where you work for 150 minutes, divide it into 6 Pomodoros and get things done faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guarantee you that despite the 5-minute breaks, you get more work done faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-e56096cf-99ad-4efd-acf5-2436e397a8c7\">#8 Create Time For Learning<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Working hard is essential, but you should also think about moving ahead in your life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to be working till you&#8217;re ninety, right? That&#8217;s why you should start looking for passive income ideas and make money work for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to accomplish that is by starting investing in gold or cryptocurrency. And the easiest way to do that is with <a href=\"https:\/\/incomeinsider.org\/\">IncomeInsider<\/a>. It&#8217;s a site that helps beginners start with investing and diversifying their income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><img width=\"602\" height=\"389\" src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/Dk_GRy26SP6CJVIuzv9jjosrBrz3iYwea1GVsKB0Z3hHmHOoJBzOVBQO2l5M5fa4o1osMEyhcQwgBbQJ6fud245lvp2v-UdatT_ybTBD255g6lnOLR7J3EB4ESJIO0vtpVgsrQDd\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one of the best ways to learn about investing and start it with minimal risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This step is crucial because, after a few years of working, you can burn out. Having a side income from investing will help you prevent that and make your time blocking a lot more bearable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"block-2eb6e75f-088f-439f-81b8-cc74b4e9db20\">#9 Schedule a Catch-Up Day<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every day is perfect, and you&#8217;ll surely experience unexpected situations at some point.
