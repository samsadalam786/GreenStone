You\u2019ve sought out your friends and loved ones for advice. You\u2019ve even come close to doing it once or twice. But alas, there\u2019s always something stopping you from quitting your job for the freelance life.<br \/>\nWell no more! Here are the top reasons to pull the trigger and join the freelance ranks:<\/p>\n<h2>Let\u2019s Get Flexible! Freelance Flexible!<\/h2>\n<p>Not everyone is built for the 9-to-5 grind especially nowadays where employees are expected to work 9-to-6, or -7, or -8, and beyond. Loved ones never described me as a \u201cmorning person\u201d so it was very difficult for me to be on this strict work schedule. I\u2019d start to get anxious when my night owl body wasn\u2019t ready for bed at a reasonable hour. With freelancing, your work schedule can be flexible to fit you. Isn\u2019t a little flexibility what everyone wants in life?<\/p>\n<h2>Remember Hobbies? Freelancers Do!<\/h2>\n<p>As kids, we are pushed to explore different hobbies we might like. One day, we might have gone to a dance class and the next day we might have played soccer. We were discovering who we were outside of school and developing our interests! As an adult, hectic schedules and responsibility stifle that growth. Since flexibility is key in freelance life, it allows you to open yourself up to explore your interests on your own time. For instance, I\u2019ve been using my flexible schedule to learn how to cook. I\u2019ve made a quinoa thing, this cauliflower thing, and this chicken thing. All of those dishes could have come out catastrophically but they were delicious and so far no one has gotten sick from my new leap into the culinary arts.<\/p>\n<h2>WERK IT Wearing\u00a0Whatever You Want<\/h2>\n<p>I\u2019m not going to lie\u2026I hate business attire. I hate it so much I would wear the same out-of-date, run down clothes for years until it got to a point where I was told I needed to put a bit more effort into my outfits when the big wigs were in the office. And my bosses\u2019 weren\u2019t wrong. Not only did I walk around my office in proverbial rags, I walked around in literal rags. I would wrap myself in a tattered blanket and roam the halls without shoes. (Takeaway: formal office life is not for me.) Outside of meetings, freelance life allows you to dress like YOU. Not in clothes that most of the time have ONE USE and that use is to sit in a chair for eight hours a day. So take off those stifling dress pants and forget having to wear a full suit in 90-degree weather, you can work and WERK in whatever you want.<\/p>\n<h2>No Office Drama: Eat Your Tuna Sandwich In Peace<\/h2>\n<p>No longer do you need to worry about opening up your smelly lunch and apologizing to everyone because your food \u201csmells like farts.&#8221; Rip those hard-boiled eggs open and guzzle them up. You\u2019ve got no one to worry about but yourself.<\/p>\n<h1>Useless Meetings&#8230;BE GONE.<\/h1>\n<p>There\u2019s an old proverb from the bible or something that says, \u201cI survived a meeting that could have been an email\u201d. Office culture is a breeding ground for useless meetings that take up company and employee time. If you work in an office, prepare to sit in conference rooms thinking to yourself, \u201cWhy am I here? I have no idea what these people are talking about.\u201d If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get a muffin or something for your time. With freelance, your time spent in useless meetings is cut drastically and that\u2019s worth having to buy yourself your own muffin.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Hold Back Tears<\/h2>\n<p>Some days you just need to cry and crying in an office can be tough. You come back to your desk, your face all blotchy, and co-workers you hate are asking you \u201care you okay?\u201d If you\u2019re freelancing, stock up on those tissues. You can cry as loud as you want both when you have to and because you can.<\/p>\n<h2>The Decision is YOURS<\/h2>\n<p>As a freelancer, you decide what projects you do and do not take. You don\u2019t have a boss forcing you to work on a useless, time-consuming assignment that may never see the light of day. This was one of the biggest realizations I had when I started working freelance. I realized that the most amazing thing was that my brain capacity was no longer filled with work and knowledge that wasn\u2019t in service to my career goal. It was like I received \u201cbrain real estate\u201d for free. When you freelance, the decision of what you\u2019re going to work on becomes yours and it\u2019s honestly a gift.<br \/>\nDo you need any more reasons to take the leap? Sure it\u2019s scary and there are important things to set into place, but think of the ripped t-shirts and tuna sandwiches you can eat while doing the work you want to be doing. Now, stop talking about it, put the plan into motion, and WERK it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You\u2019ve been thinking about it.
