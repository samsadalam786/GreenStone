They\u2019re always hustling, finding their next gig; straight up bosses doing it for themselves. But if there\u2019s one thing that all freelancers will avoid, it\u2019s learning invoicing software. Sure, it\u2019s meant to be easy, but it\u2019s so tedious that we can&#8217;t help but list&nbsp;all the things we would rather do on&nbsp;a summer day.<\/p>\n<h2>How Wrong Is Wikipedia?<\/h2>\n<p>While you\u2019re trying to get a hang of invoicing software, take a moment (or all 25 hours it typically takes to learn those things) to answer a question as old as time: \u201c<em>How wrong is Wikipedia?<\/em>\u201d We all know the common user writes information on the site and if there\u2019s anything that the Internet has taught us it\u2019s that Internet users are sometimes dummies. So buckle down and start researching. It&#8217;s now your job to make this world a bit smarter.<\/p>\n<h2>Find That Pair Of Headphones From Two Years Ago<\/h2>\n<p>You need some headphones to focus in on that deadline and your go-to pair just gave out. You KNOW those earbuds are in your house and you\u2019re on a mission to find them. You won\u2019t stop till that free pair from the airplane is back in your hands!<\/p>\n<h2>Reconcile With a Mortal Enemy<\/h2>\n<p>You know what lays on you? Holding grudges. It gives you bad juju. You\u2019ve been meaning to work it out to your mortal enemy for oh, ages now, but you\u2019ve just never had the time! You never really wanted to resolve these past woes until you had to face hours of learning new software&#8230;what a coincidence! Well, would you look at that, just as you were about to learn QuickBooks you had this sudden urge to break out your old address book and finally call Jim, the devil that slathered gum all over your hair in fourth grade. Sure, balancing the books is important but think about how clear your aura will be to tell Jim &#8220;no hard feelings&#8221;.<br \/>\nWell, would you look at that, just as you were about to learn QuickBooks you had this sudden urge to break out your old address book and finally call Jim, the devil that slathered gum all over your hair in fourth grade. Sure, balancing the books is important but think about how clear your aura will be to tell Jim &#8220;no hard feelings&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h2>Learn To Cook A Bouillabaisse<\/h2>\n<p>The day to figure out invoicing software is (shocker) also the day to cook a fish stew you can\u2019t pronounce.<\/p>\n<h2>Re-watch <em>The Office<\/em><\/h2>\n<p>The hit television show, <em>The Office,<\/em> features accountants Oscar, Angela, and Kevin. There\u2019s a solid chance that they were using invoicing software, so watching all nine seasons of <em>The Office<\/em> is practically homework. While you\u2019re at it, you might as well binge the three seasons of the British <em>Office<\/em>&nbsp;as well. Not only will you undoubtedly be completing your assignment, you can make a definitive decision on which you think is the better couple: Pam and Jim or Tim and Dawn?<\/p>\n<h2>Get Your Teeth Cleaned<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cAn apple a day keeps the doctor away, but it won\u2019t keep the dentist at bay\u201d is a lesser-known extension of the popular rhyme because if you\u2019ve been eating a lot of apples, your teeth need a good scrub! Sure, it\u2019s unpleasant to get those pearly whites white, but at least you\u2019ll feel&nbsp;a little less agitated than how it feels to learn complicated software.<\/p>\n<h2>Become A Social Media Star!<\/h2>\n<p>Because getting a ton of strangers to follow you seems easier than learning this darn software.<br \/>\nHonestly, this list could go on and on because learning invoicing software is another task freelancers don\u2019t need to have on their plate. That\u2019s why you should sign up for Fiverr Workspace because they want to do those tasks for you. WHAT. A. DREAM. Also, tell all of your followers to sign up as well after you become the social media star you always dreamed of being!<br \/>\n<em>If you&#8217;re still not ready to use the software, get started with these <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoice-templates\">free invoice templates<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freelancers are a tough breed.
