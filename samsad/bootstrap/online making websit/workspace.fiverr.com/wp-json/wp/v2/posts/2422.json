As a freelancer, yes, you make your own schedule\u2014and you should absolutely schedule some time to hit the gym\u2014but tax season is also looming. And so are all those deadlines.<br \/>\nAlso, those gifts you bought on credit in December? Yeah, that bill is due. Like, yesterday.<br \/>\nThe weather is bleak. Don\u2019t even look at the wind chill factor. Pretend it doesn\u2019t exist.<br \/>\nThe third Monday of January\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.mirror.co.uk\/news\/weird-news\/when-blue-monday-2017-heres-9550568?service=responsive\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commonly referred to as \u201cBlue Monday\u201d<\/a>\u2014is right around the corner. Researchers say this is the most depressing day of the year, but don\u2019t let it get you down. We\u2019ve compiled some ways to fight off the winter blues below.<\/p>\n<h3>Move\u00a0your body.<\/h3>\n<p>Exercise has long been considered one of the best ways to stave off depression, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.health.harvard.edu\/mind-and-mood\/exercise-and-depression-report-excerpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies have proven just that<\/a>. One important factor to note, though, is that although there are short-term benefits from exercise, the benefits accumulate\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/2011\/12\/exercise.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sticking to it produces more and better benefits<\/a>.<br \/>\nAny exercise at all <a href=\"https:\/\/www.webmd.com\/depression\/guide\/exercise-depression#1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">seems to produce benefits<\/a>. Even just doing some yard work or taking a walk. Freelancers are busy. We get it. But, <a href=\"https:\/\/well.blogs.nytimes.com\/2016\/04\/27\/1-minute-of-all-out-exercise-may-equal-45-minutes-of-moderate-exertion\/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">according to the <em>New York Times<\/em><\/a>, one minute of the right kind of exercise can provide great benefits for your health. One minute. It\u2019s hard to make excuses now, isn\u2019t it?<br \/>\nOne study showed depression levels were <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/22053537\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reduced from dancing<\/a>. Fortunately, we have a song suggestion that fits our theme: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ftJZomwDhxQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201cBlue Monday\u201d by New Order<\/a>. Seriously. Queue it up and spaz out around your bedroom. If you don\u2019t feel better after, or if you\u2019re a 90s kid who needs some nostalgia, try <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aJZTfl3DmCU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Orgy\u2019s cover of the same song<\/a>.<br \/>\nOkay, now that we\u2019ve taken a dance break, on to our next trick: Practice gratitude.<\/p>\n<h3>Embrace the power of positive thinking.<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.psy.miami.edu\/faculty\/mmccullough\/gratitude\/Emmons_McCullough_2003_JPSP.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Science has shown<\/a> that practicing gratitude is one of the best ways to lift your spirits. There are a lot of ways to focus on the things you are grateful for, from making a daily list, to actually reaching out to people to express gratitude\u2014make one phone call or send one email telling someone why you appreciate them and chances are you will feel happier afterward. You can do this every day.<br \/>\nThe fact is, we take a lot for granted. If you\u2019re reading this, you have a connection to the internet\u2014something a lot of the world may not have access to. That\u2019s just one thing to be grateful for, but chances are if you take a moment to think about your life, you can find a lot more to be grateful for, even if it is as simple as the cup of coffee you\u2019re about to enjoy.<br \/>\nFreelancers, consider this: We\u2019re living in a golden age for creative types and for remote workers. The internet has provided us with endless opportunities, as well as the ability to work from anywhere in the world, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/skillcrush.com\/2016\/03\/01\/useful-resources-for-freelancers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amount of resources for freelancers is ever-growing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>For psychological well-being, do something good.<\/h1>\n<p>The list of ways that volunteerism helps with both mental and physical health is stunning. Just take a look at a few of the benefits from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3804225\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one study<\/a> in <em>Psychological Aging<\/em>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular volunteers were found to have lower levels of hypertension.<\/li>\n<li>Volunteers were also found to have increases in psychological well-being.<\/li>\n<li>Many studies have \u201cconsistently linked volunteerism to lower all-cause mortality among older adults.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some of those psychological benefits found include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>More satisfaction with life;<\/li>\n<li>Better self-esteem;<\/li>\n<li>A stronger sense of personal control; and<\/li>\n<li>A decrease in depressive symptoms.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Volunteering, it seems, can quite literally save your life. For Americans, \u201cBlue Monday\u201d falls on the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday\u2014many workers will have off for the day, and what better way to celebrate than by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N9mptmJ_QjA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doing some good<\/a>? Not only will you be helping the cause you choose to support, but you\u2019ll also be helping yourself at the same time.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s the ultimate win-win situation.<\/p>\n<h3>Smile\u2014even when you don&#8217;t feel like it.<\/h3>\n<p>Smiling, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/health\/archive\/2012\/07\/study-forcing-a-smile-genuinely-decreases-stress\/260513\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">even if the smile is forced<\/a>, has repeatedly been shown to decrease stress, and it\u2019s so easy to do. Try it now. Even if your day is full of deadlines, meetings, and, oh yeah, you\u2019ve still got to send all those invoices because it\u2019s the end of the month\u2014stressing about it all doesn\u2019t help get it done.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fblue-monday-2017%2F&#038;text=Say%20no%20to%20the%20duck-face%3A%20The%20sheer%20act%20of%20faking%20a%20smile%20can%20instantly%20improve%20your%20mood.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Say no to the duck-face: The sheer act of faking a smile can instantly improve your mood. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fblue-monday-2017%2F&#038;text=Say%20no%20to%20the%20duck-face%3A%20The%20sheer%20act%20of%20faking%20a%20smile%20can%20instantly%20improve%20your%20mood.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nMaybe the best way to keep yourself happy is to do a combination of all of the tricks we listed: Smile while you list the things you are grateful for, then go for a jog before heading out to the volunteer job you do for a cause you really care about. Most importantly, give yourself the time you need to focus on these things for at least a few minutes per day and watch your outlook begin to change for the better.<br \/>\n<strong>Have some positivity hacks of your own to share?
