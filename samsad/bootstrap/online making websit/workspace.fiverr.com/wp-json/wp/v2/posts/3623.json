That holds true with business and it undoubtedly holds true with personal branding. The sooner you start leveraging thought leadership to build your own channels, the more exposure you can bring to your own expertise within your industry. When done right, it can grow your network and opportunities, especially amongst business-centric platforms like LinkedIn and Medium.<br \/>\nWhile working on how others see you can seem like a second job or another gig to add to your schedule, it can lead to plenty of inbound opportunities in the long run.<br \/>\nIn 2016, I was named No. 5 among <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/linked-top-voices-2016-10-must-know-writers-marketing-laura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LinkedIn&#8217;s Top Voices<\/a> in Marketing\u2014a distinction given the top ten thought leaders and content creators within a specific vertical. Here\u2019s what I learned about being successful with long-form content, applicable for both LinkedIn and Medium.<\/p>\n<h3>Growing your audience on LinkedIn<\/h3>\n<p>In the race for virality, we\u2019ve all reached the point of frustration where what you\u2019ve written doesn\u2019t produce the return you\u2019ve expected.\u00a0LinkedIn is a prioritized channel for businesses, especially with it\u2019s growing community of engaged users looking to expand their own network. Now, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/linkedin-top-voices-2016-here-writers-you-need-know-start-daniel-roth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">160,000 new articles<\/a> per week on LinkedIn, entrepreneurs and freelancers\u00a0are using the platform to grow their audiences and\u00a0their businesses.<br \/>\nI molded my own approach to publishing on LinkedIn and identified a handful of easily replicable tactics:<br \/>\n<b>Choosing the right topic<\/b><br \/>\nMany times, the methods for optimizing content will vary across platforms, and that is inherently true with publishing on LinkedIn. LinkedIn has <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.linkedin.com\/2017\/march\/22\/introducing-trending-storylines-discover-trending-news-and-views-on-LinkedIn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">just announced Storylines<\/a> which help users with a head start when it comes to identifying trending topics and themes\u00a0worth writing about.<br \/>\nThe difference in this platform lies here: LinkedIn has become a syndicated outlet for news reporters and media publishers, so you must speak from a new, fresh angle about a timely trend. Choosing the right event, from the right perspective, can increase your story\u2019s exposure and engagement. In short, your post\u00a0must present a new point-of-view if you want to reach a mass audience.<br \/>\n<strong>Getting the timing right<\/strong><br \/>\nAs a business professional writing to other business professionals, it\u2019s vital that you take everyone\u2019s schedule into consideration when looking to publish. The best writers have aligned their posting schedule with anticipated activity on LinkedIn. As someone who\u2019s a part of the audience you\u2019re writing to, assume their role for a second when you\u2019re deciding when to push your content live.<br \/>\nMonday mornings are usually inopportune times, as many of the readers you want to reach are catching up on the weekend\u2019s emails, rather than browsing their LinkedIn feeds. This same thought process applies to Friday afternoon, when people are just as busy finishing their week\u2019s work in preparation for the weekend.<br \/>\nPut your posts in the best position of being seen by finding the right schedule for your immediate audience.\u00a0Data shows that posts published on Thursdays see\u00a0the <a href=\"https:\/\/okdork.com\/linkedin-publishing-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">highest average total views<\/a>, closely followed by Sunday.<br \/>\n<strong>Using the algorithm to your advantage<\/strong><br \/>\nEngaging in conversation with those who comment or share your content is crucial<b>\u00a0<\/b>for growing your readership on any platform. It&#8217;s arguably even\u00a0more important when it comes to your success on LinkedIn, since LinkedIn&#8217;s algorithm rewards active conversation.<br \/>\nThe algorithm uses a few ways to tap into additional networks through those who&#8217;ve engaged with your work. When a user likes or comments on an article of yours, it appears on their network feed. LinkedIn\u2019s product is built to present content that similar audiences would be interested in and find valuable.<br \/>\nYou can hack this product feature to your own benefit by starting conversations with those who have responded to your content. Interaction in the comments section of an article is the reason behind the success of many of my LinkedIn articles\u2014not to mention that the most engaged threads will get pinned to the top of the comment section.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fcontent-tips-linkedin-medium%2F&#038;text=On%20LinkedIn%2C%20engaging%20with%20those%20who%20comment%20or%20share%20your%20content%20is%20critical%20to%20growing%20an%20audience.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">On LinkedIn, engaging with those who comment or share your content is critical to growing an audience. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fcontent-tips-linkedin-medium%2F&#038;text=On%20LinkedIn%2C%20engaging%20with%20those%20who%20comment%20or%20share%20your%20content%20is%20critical%20to%20growing%20an%20audience.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nTagging individuals who have their own followings is another method of garnering more exposure, but be wary of overdoing it and appearing too spammy in your approach. That said, including\u00a0other (relevant!) thought leaders in the conversation\u00a0can bring in credible perspectives from which your readers will ultimately benefit.<\/p>\n<h3>Same methods, different Medium<\/h3>\n<p>Your presence on Medium will benefit from these same practices. To be more efficient,\u00a0it&#8217;s advisable to find a\u00a0way to repurpose the content you\u2019ve spent so long writing amongst different platforms.\u00a0Since most people&#8217;s\u00a0LinkedIn audiences vary from that of their Medium profiles, repackaging content is a common practice here.<br \/>\nMedium is similar to publishing on LinkedIn in many ways, but it also differs largely in the fact that it doesn\u2019t have as large of a built-in audience of readers who actively engage and network there.\u00a0For context, LinkedIn has <a href=\"https:\/\/expandedramblings.com\/index.php\/by-the-numbers-a-few-important-linkedin-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">460 million+ members<\/a>; Medium has <a href=\"https:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2016\/01\/19\/technology\/medium-ev-williams\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30 million users<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Distribution is key<\/h3>\n<p>As you well know, your work isn\u2019t done once it\u2019s published\u00a0and dismissing distribution does\u00a0yourself and your creativity a disservice. The true test comes in what you do immediately after you\u2019ve posted. Where are you sharing this content and to whom?<br \/>\nSyndication is a major catalyst for\u00a0any trending post on LinkedIn and Medium. Few\u00a0things are more important than earning early traction on your article. Consider pushing your content to relevant LinkedIn Groups as\u00a0these communities are full of decision makers in the industry, which is a prime opportunity to introduce them to you and your brand. But, at the same time, it must provide value in an organic way, and that is achieved with the techniques above.<br \/>\nBoth LinkedIn and Medium house a community of hungry enthusiasts in their own right. It\u2019s quite possible to build your thought leadership brand and convert new business with the right narrative and approach.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Thought leadership is a winning tactic for any solopreneur looking to raise his or her profile.
