There are phone interviews to be scheduled, emails to be followed up on, client leads that need to be clinched, and projects that need to be finished. Fortunately, there&#8217;s also a number of <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tools-resources-for-freelancers\/\">great tools that can help with a variety of tasks<\/a>, all designed to make your working life easier, your decision making better, and your future brighter. <\/span><br \/>\nHere are some tools any freelancer should consider using:<\/p>\n<h3><b>FollowUp.CC: Keep Communication Flowing<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Have you ever had a project stall because you were waiting for a response from someone and forgot to follow up? Or because you weren&#8217;t sure whether your email had been read at all, but you thought it was rude to ask whether it had been?<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about because you forgot to answer that email you glanced at when you were only half awake at 4 a.m.? Or the one you glanced at during half time of the Super Bowl party&#8230;nevermind, let&#8217;s not talk about that Super Bowl party. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/followup.cc\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FollowUp.CC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> takes care of all of these problems, and more: You can set reminders to email people, track how often and when your emails are read, and set automatic follow ups to emails that you never received a response to.<\/span><br \/>\nThose are only some of the great features, though: Let&#8217;s say you work with a client in Hong Kong, but you live in New York and you want to send emails during your client&#8217;s working hours Then use FollowUp.CC to schedule those emails for later, so those emails will be firing away while you&#8217;re sleeping and you can rest easy.<br \/>\nMost importantly, tools like FollowUp.CC save you a lot of time: And time is your most valuable asset as a freelancer.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Yesware: Data to Help You Take The Next Step<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone needs to know where they&#8217;ve been to know where they are going, unless you&#8217;re the guy in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Memento. <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In which case, good luck.<\/span><br \/>\nIn sales or landing clients, knowing where you&#8217;ve been means analyzing what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and what you can change to make sure you hit (or ideally exceed) all of your goals.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Yesware, not only do you get the data in an easy-to-digest way, but you also get prescriptive analytics. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.yesware.com\/prescriptive-analytics\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Their website describes it best<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: \u201cPrescriptive analytics combs through a variety of data sources to give actionable advice on how to get where you want to be&#8230;The true power of prescriptive data is in unearthing practical findings that you can act on immediately.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\nYesware tracks engagement with emails, including how many were opened, how many led to clicks, and number of responses. What if those thousands of emails you sent over the years were not as effective as they could have been? How many opportunities could you have been missing? Yesware allows you to assess exactly that, maximizing the value of you and your staff&#8217;s efforts.<br \/>\nYesware can not only help to make your business thrive, but also can help you learn how to be a better salesperson.<\/p>\n<h3><b>Drag: Organize Your Inbox<\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Touting itself as the Trello in Gmail, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dragapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this app<\/a> will organize your inbox in a cinch.<br \/>\nWith Drag, officially launching Summer 2017, you simply head to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dragapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">site<\/a>\u00a0and add the tool as a Chrome extension where you then sign into your Gmail account and your inbox is *magically* transformed into the columns &#8220;To Do&#8221; &#8220;Doing&#8221; and &#8220;Done&#8221;. Your e-mails will all start in the &#8220;To Do&#8221; phase and then based on your own preferred workflow, you&#8217;ll be able to effectively toggle through each phase and get the hang of each stage pretty quickly and adapt it to your personal needs.<br \/>\nWant to get back to your old inbox? You simply turn off the Drag feature and your inbox will be back to its original state, which is a pretty great feature for comparative reasons and to get used to the new and improved workflow Drag will provide you.<br \/>\nThis tool will not only clean up your inbox, but by organizing all e-amils into simple to-do lists, it&#8217;s one less list you have to worry about during your hectic workday!<\/p>\n<h3><b>Streak: Do It All In One Window<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The name of the company, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.streak.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Streak<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, tells it all: It conjures up images of speed, something whizzing by in a flash.

Each of these subjects are big, bold, and colorful, and you can move the email addresses of each possible candidate for the position from one step to the next. That way you don&#8217;t have to remember which John Smith was the one you wanted to hire and which was the one that never made it past the phone interview!<\/p>\n<p>You can use Streak to keep track of who you have followed up with, showed a demo, or started negotiating with.

With <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/rapportive.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rapportive<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> you get more than just that: You get their entire LinkedIn profile right inside Gmail. That way it&#8217;s easy to know that, hey, it just so happens that your newest client lives in the town you grew up in or, hey, your oldest client just changed jobs. Knowing these things can lead to a better rapport (yes, I had to use the word) with that client.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Or what if you see that the CEO of your old company (who you are still on outstanding terms with because you don&#8217;t burn bridges) is also in the LinkedIn network of someone you want to hire to help you with a project. How much easier is it to get a reference when you can then simply pick up your phone and shoot off a text to your old buddy?<br \/>\nNot only does Rapportive allow you to make connections that you might not have otherwise made, but it saves you a lot of time. Each minute spent Googling someone&#8217;s history is a minute you&#8217;re not billing a client or generating a new lead.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All those minutes add up, but thanks to Rapportive, now you&#8217;ve got a whole lot more of them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Insightly: Great for Small Businesses<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.insightly.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insightly<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is designed for small businesses.
