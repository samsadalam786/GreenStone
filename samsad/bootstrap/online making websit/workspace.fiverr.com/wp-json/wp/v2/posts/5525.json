Before long, you\u2019ll likely have found a schedule that works for you and slipped into your own groove. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t get me wrong: routine can be a good thing. Setting up some structure for your day will help you feel more ordered and calm. Not to mention, you can be more productive if you don\u2019t have to waste energy every day on decisions about what to work on, when. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if you stick with them too long, routines can become monotonous and your calm can quickly turn to boredom or frustration. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding little ways to break out of your routine can\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/10-ways-to-coerce-creativity-when-youre-in-a-lull\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rejuvenate your creativity<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and productivity, and help you feel happier with your working life. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are a few things to try.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>1. Start your morning with something different\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your typical morning consists of rolling out of bed, feeling around for the coffee maker, and rubbing the sleep out of your eyes while your computer wakes up, perhaps a little shift in the way you start your day is just what you need. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you have a little more energy than that in your mornings, choosing a different way to spend the time directly before work could have a real impact on how the rest of your day pans out. Give a new form of exercise a go, meditate, listen to a podcast, read some industry news, or try a hobby you\u2019ve always wanted to try. Make the most of the time outside of your work, and you\u2019ll feel much more inclined to make your working hours count, too. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>2. Add some new scenery to your day<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of major benefits of freelancing is your ability to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/anywhere-workers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">work from anywhere<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Even if it\u2019s just for half the day, go and work in a coffee shop, a library, or outside in the park. You could even work from a new city for the day, with a little planning. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New scenery can help get your inspirational juices flowing. If you can\u2019t change your workspace, try taking a new route there (which might mean a walk around the block if you\u2019re working from home). Maybe you can even find a new way of commuting, like riding a bike or taking public transport. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>3. Shake up your lunch break<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you typically go for the same sandwich day in, day out, give yourself a reward once a week by finding a new recipe to make for your lunch or a new local cafe to try out. Or spend your lunch hour doing something different &#8211; like meeting up with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-to-make-freelance-friends\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a freelance friend<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, working out, or learning something new. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>4. Listen to music <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right music can lift your spirits, help you focus, and get rid of tension. I like to genre hop each day. One day I\u2019m back in the \u201860s, the next I\u2019m at an EDM festival, and the next it\u2019s reggae all the way. It\u2019s such an easy thing to change, and it adds a little interest to my work week. I also keep a group chat with a bunch of music-loving friends where we each share a \u2018song of the day\u2019, so we can always find something new to listen to. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>5. Review your habits regularly<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try the \u2018Stop, Start, and Keep Doing\u2019 method. At the beginning or end of the week, make time for some reflection on what&#8217;s working well for you, what you need to let go of, and what new habits to incorporate in your life. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Time to change it up<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They say a change is as good as a holiday, so perhaps all you need is a break in your monotony to feel as if you\u2019ve taken a break. You don\u2019t necessarily need to overhaul your whole work routine; with a little rearrangement or reshuffling, you\u2019ll feel rejuvenated and re-inspired. And if that doesn\u2019t work\u2026 \u00a0maybe an actual holiday is in order. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you\u2019re a freelancer or a remote worker, chances are you\u2019ve already got much less monotony in your work routine than your buddies who work in<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":128,"featured_media":9919,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":true,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>5 Ways to Break the Monotony of Your Work Routine<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Even freelancers fall into routines.
