I\u2019d like to share with you my best advice for freelancers who want to grow their freelancing into a full-time job that easily supports them. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My advice comes from the time I\u2019ve spent working full-time for myself successfully but, more importantly, from the countless hours I\u2019ve spent working with thousands of freelancers every day through my blog and online community.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, these are <em>not<\/em> get-rich-quick ideas. They aren\u2019t going to transform your life or your freelance business overnight.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tactics take hard work. Intense work. Long days. Some nights. Not every freelancer is cut out for this path, which is why so many freelancers struggle to find work while a select few are cashing really big client checks.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you\u2019re willing to put in the work, these ideas <em>can<\/em> work for you. And they can deliver in big ways.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you\u2019re up for it, read on and you\u2019ll find my best advice for freelancers who are ready to finally break out of the feast-famine cycle and build a sustainable, reliable business.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advice #1: Stop waiting for jobs to come to you.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve been actively participating in the freelancing community online for about a decade. And I\u2019m still shocked that the majority of freelancers claim \u201cword of mouth\u201d is the #1 way they find new clients.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not calling them liars.<br><br>It might be true.<br><br>But what kind of advice is that for someone who\u2019s ready to give freelancing a try? Or who\u2019s dying to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/make-digital-nomad-leap\/\">make the leap<\/a> from full-time job to freelancing? Or the freelancer who\u2019s struggling to make ends meet every month?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s terrible advice, that\u2019s what.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s so passive. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many freelancers, they\u2019re not working with nearly enough clients currently to get any meaningful number of word-of-mouth referrals from them. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while word-of-mouth marketing may prove extremely successful once you\u2019ve already been freelancing for years\u2014satisfying clients and refining your referral process\u2014it\u2019s just not logical if you\u2019re already struggling to find work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What should you do instead?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends a lot on what kinds of clients you\u2019re looking for.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, you could <a href=\"https:\/\/fiverr.com\">sign up for sites like Fiverr<\/a> where you list a clear task, your qualifications, and some samples, thereby allowing potential clients to find you in their extensive marketplace.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s still pretty passive. Remember, the goal is to stop waiting for jobs to come to you.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A bit better would be to <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/freelance-job-sites\">try searching freelance jobs websites<\/a> for clients that match your skill set, timeline, and interest areas. Actively reach out to clients with freelance jobs that you want.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m also a major fan of knocking on doors, cold-emailing or cold-calling to find clients. In fact, I\u2019ve used cold-emailing to build my six-figure solo business.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be a successful cold-pitcher, however, takes work and practice. It takes knowledge of selling. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings me to my next point: in order to build a better freelance business, you <em>have<\/em> to learn how to sell yourself.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advice #2: You <em>have<\/em> to learn how to sell.<\/h3>\n\n\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fwhy-some-freelancers-bring-in-big-money-while-others-struggle-to-find-work%2F&#038;text=In%20order%20to%20build%20a%20better%20%23freelance%20business%2C%20you%20have%20to%20learn%20how%20to%20sell%20yourself.&#038;related' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In order to build a better #freelance business, you have to learn how to sell yourself. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fwhy-some-freelancers-bring-in-big-money-while-others-struggle-to-find-work%2F&#038;text=In%20order%20to%20build%20a%20better%20%23freelance%20business%2C%20you%20have%20to%20learn%20how%20to%20sell%20yourself.&#038;related' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether clients miraculously start coming to you or you have to start knocking doors doesn\u2019t really matter. In both scenarios, you <em>have<\/em> to know how to sell yourself.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s one of the most common pitfalls I see in new and experienced freelancers alike: <a href=\"https:\/\/doubleyourfreelancing.com\/4-mistakes-when-selling\/\">we don\u2019t learn how to effectively master the art of sales<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re great designers or developers or writers or coaches. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we\u2019re terrible salespeople.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m here to tell you: it\u2019s holding you back.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, you should think of every single moment as a selling opportunity.* <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re chatting with the owner of the local coffee shop you visit almost every day? Selling moment.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-write-great-proposals-that-win-you-more-freelance-projects\/\">drafting up a proposal<\/a>? The deal\u2019s not done yet. Selling moment.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when you\u2019re wrapping up the final details on a successful client project? Yep, selling moment. <br><br>But what should you be selling <em>after<\/em> you\u2019re finished with a client project? Keep reading into the next section and I\u2019ll tell you.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To become a good salesperson will take time, practice, hard work and patience. You can expedite the process by searching for sales courses, reading some of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/best-business-books\/\">the best business books for freelancers<\/a>, joining social communities, or even getting a part-time sales job to learn from someone who\u2019s been selling for decades. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>*Note: I don\u2019t mean in that sleazy way your neighbor tries to get you to come to jewelry parties or your cousin tries to sell you essential oils in some sort of pyramid scheme. Selling can be incredibl natural and unobtrusive when done correctly.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advice #3: Focus on converting one-time clients into recurring revenue.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common complaints I hear from freelancers is the <a href=\"https:\/\/convertkit.com\/finances-for-freelancers\/\">ever-gnawing presence of the feast-famine cycle<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s annoying. You work yourself to the bone promoting your business. Selling, selling, selling. Which means you have a great month (or two) of steady client work, exciting projects, and money in the bank. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before you know it, those projects are over and\u2014because you\u2019ve been working so hard on client projects\u2014you\u2019re back where you were: with lots of time and very little client work to fill that time.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What successful freelancers do well that you haven\u2019t figured out yet is the art of turning one-time clients into recurring revenue.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/productizeandscale.com\/why-productized-service\/\">Some people call it \u201cProductizing\u201d<\/a> your services. Other people call it \u201cretainer work\u201d. Whatever you choose to call it, it\u2019s basically the same thing:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Recurring client revenue.<\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revenue you can depend on; that you can expect every month for the foreseeable future.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to go from one-off clients to recurring revenue, you might have to tinker with your business model a bit first. For example, instead of offering one-off coaching sessions, try offering a lower monthly coaching fee that adds up over a series of months.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a designer, try an \u201con-call\u201d model where your client sends you small jobs throughout the month which you complete in sequence in return for a monthly subscription fee.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, if you\u2019re mostly freelancing through marketplaces, use the built-in communication features to pitch more services on a regular basis.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the old business adage reminds us: it\u2019s much easier to keep a current customer than to find a brand-new one.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convincing clients to sign a retainer deal isn\u2019t the only way to build more predictable revenue into your business, though. Read on.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advice #4: Build systems that bring you passive income.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s an important distinction I need to make before we continue here. There\u2019s a difference between passive income and recurring revenue.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of freelancers mix those up.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They claim they want to build recurring revenue when what they really want is money that comes every month without any additional work\u2014that\u2019s passive income. <br><br>There are <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-freelancers-generate-passive-income\/\">lots of ways freelancers can build passive income into their businesses.<\/a><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, try looking at the byproduct of the services you provide for clients. If you\u2019re a web designer, are their elements of a client project you could sell as a plugin or in marketplaces like Envato\u2019s CodeCanyon?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a writer, could you take time each week to write for yourself instead of just your clients and thereby start a blog that eventually makes money? Or could you write an ebook on a topic you\u2019re passionate about and find avenues in which to sell it?<br><br>If you\u2019re a coach, could you take the most common issues your student are faced with and create a course clients who can\u2019t afford your coaching services could take instead?<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving true 100% passive income status is next to impossible. But you can build pockets of passive income into your freelance business to supplement any client revenue you\u2019re bringing in. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advice #5: Prepare to raise your rates.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re on the hunt for articles about how to make more money as a freelancer (like I\u2019m sharing in this one), I\u2019m 100% certain you\u2019re going to come across a thousand posts about <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/raising-your-freelance-rates-in-2019-heres-how-to-do-it-right\/\">raising your rates<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look\u2026 I\u2019m a big fan of raising your rates. I agree with the idea that most freelancers probably do need to be charging more.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, I\u2019m really worried that it seems to be such a common fix-all solution for struggling freelancers. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desperate freelancers everywhere are \u201craising their rates\u201d all because they read it on the blog of some super-successful fellow freelancer and they find themselves in the same position as before: unable to find clients or make any money.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don\u2019t just raise your rates for the sake of raising your rates. Here are a couple ways to know if it\u2019s time to raise your prices:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You already have a full client roster at your current rates and more clients keep coming your way without much effort.<\/li><li>New clients don\u2019t negotiate at all on price\u2014a sign they see far more value in your work than what you\u2019re charging.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re experiencing these phenomena and still not making as much money as you\u2019d like to or need to each month, then it\u2019s definitely time to raise your rates. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/my-freelance-life\/id1337845985?mt=2\">One freelancer that I checked in with<\/a> almost weekly for an entire year after quitting his full-time job started first by charging <em>double<\/em> what he was making at his day job.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he doubled that rate.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then he doubled it again.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re keeping track, he\u2019s now making <em>eight times <\/em>per hour what he was making at his desk job. Imagine how that could change your life.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you\u2019ve got systems in place, you\u2019re finding clients using selling and job hunting as I recommended above, and you\u2019re clipping along, follow the path of some of the most successful freelancers I know and start charging more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>You\u2019ve got this!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of working closely with thousands of freelancers on my own blog and working for myself on the side and full-time for over a decade, I\u2019ve realized this:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>There are as many different scenarios as there are different freelancers. <\/em><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if I had to lump all of that experience together and explain the differences between struggling freelancers and those that are making six figures or more on a regular basis, the advice outlined in this article would be it.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few thoughts before I leave you:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep an abundance mentality<\/strong>\u2014there are plenty of clients, money, freelance jobs, and opportunities out there to keep you gainfully employed as a freelancer.<\/li><li><strong>Stay positive<\/strong>\u2014no one wants to work with someone who\u2019s disgruntled, rude, pessimistic or unhappy in their own job.<\/li><li><strong>Work hard<\/strong>\u2014I\u2019ve yet to meet a successful freelancer that hasn\u2019t worked very hard to get where they are. I\u2019ve also never met one who said all the work wasn&#8217;t worth it in the end. It\u2019s very worth it.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, remember: you\u2019ve got this!
