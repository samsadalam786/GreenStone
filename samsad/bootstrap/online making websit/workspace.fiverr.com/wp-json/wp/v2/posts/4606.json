Here\u2019s Your Guide"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>Freelance is a word typically associated with creatives\u2014artists, performers, designers and the like\u2014but as the gig economy has expanded, it has also transformed. Today, freelance developers are on the rise. In fact, software designers are perfect candidates for independent work: their projects are wholly digital and can be managed 100 percent remotely.<br \/>\nFor developers whose skills are particularly specific and technical, the idea of managing an independently run \u201cbusiness\u201d (i.e. yourself) might be daunting. The good news is that though there are new skills to learn, these abilities can be taught and learning them will allow you to flourish into a lucrative and fulfilling career as a freelance developer.<\/p>\n<h3>First things first: Have a safety net<\/h3>\n<p>Before jumping ship and leaving the security of your full-time gig on the table, make sure you\u2019ve socked enough savings away to sustain you until you get going.<br \/>\nDo your due diligence: talk to people freelancing as engineers; understand the opportunities within resourcing companies, at larger companies, within remote workforces, etc.<br \/>\nCreate the framework of a business plan. You don\u2019t need to have all the answers on Day 1, but you should generally know which types of clients or projects you\u2019ll seek out, and how many of them you can manage at a given time.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fwant-become-freelance-developer-heres-guide%2F&#038;text=Want%20to%20become%20a%20%23freelance%20developer%3F%20Create%20the%20framework%20of%20a%20%23business%20plan%20first.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Want to become a #freelance developer? Create the framework of a #business plan first.  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fwant-become-freelance-developer-heres-guide%2F&#038;text=Want%20to%20become%20a%20%23freelance%20developer%3F%20Create%20the%20framework%20of%20a%20%23business%20plan%20first.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Determine your freelance rate<\/h3>\n<p>There are many formulas for doing this. One of the most popular methods is to research a comparable salary of someone your position (or perhaps use what you were making before).<br \/>\nUse <a href=\"https:\/\/www.comparably.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comparably<\/a> to see what people at your level are making within your market. Be honest with yourself: Don\u2019t start with a CTO salary if you\u2019ve only been in the game for 3 years.<br \/>\nNow, add your expenses and overhead. Factor in things like: coworking\/office space; cost of materials\/supplies; health insurance; transportation, etc. Want to take a shortcut? Multiply your salary by 1.2X or 1.3X.<br \/>\nThe resulting figure is your freelance-equivalent salary. To get to an hourly rate, divide by 2,080, which reflects the average number of working hours per year, not including sick days and vacation time.<br \/>\nNow, buffer for negotiation. Aim for a slightly higher rate when speaking with potential clients, so that when it comes time to negotiate, you\u2019re able to give a bit while still sticking to your target rate. For more negotiation tips see Fiverr Workspace\u2019s guide for freelancers here.<\/p>\n<h3>Get organized<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re going to be juggling multiple clients\/projects, look into a project management tool. <a href=\"https:\/\/app.asana.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Asana<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/trello.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/evernote.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Evernote<\/a> all come highly recommended, but cater to different styles. Find what works for you.<br \/>\nStart using a time tracker! Going freelance means spending time across various projects. Avoid scope creep by being meticulous about where your time is going.<br \/>\nAutomate whatever you can! This includes creating <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/contracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contracts<\/a>, generating and following up on <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invoices<\/a>.<br \/>\nFinally, create or use a <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/contracts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contract template.<\/a>\u00a0The easiest and most important way to protect yourself as a freelancer is to establish a habit of using a secure contract every time you take on new work.<\/p>\n<h3>Craft a marketing &amp; sales strategy<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, your work will speak for itself as a developer.
