The rental rate includes insurance, maintenance and free electric charging at EVgo stations.<br \/>\nMany drivers rent or lease vehicles when working for companies like Uber and Lyft, but renting a vehicle makes it more difficult to work for multiple rideshare companies, as many drivers do to optimize the frequency of pickups. Uber\u2019s Vehicle Solution and Lyft\u2019s Express Drive programs require that drivers meet a minimum number of rides or hours per week to become eligible.<br \/>\nGig aims to address this pain point by being the go-to rental solution for drivers operating in the gig economy, allowing them to seamlessly work for multiple rideshare companies without having to worry about logging minimum hours.<br \/>\nGM isn&#8217;t the first major corporation to recognize the growing &#8220;freelance&#8221; movement and adopt their business accordingly.\u00a0Increasingly, major players are shifting their strategies, hiring structures and products to cater to the growing freelance workforce. Here are a few examples.<\/p>\n<h3>Companies are going fully remote<\/h3>\n<p>Technology is making it easier than ever to work remotely, whether that means working from home for part of the week or traveling the globe as a digital nomad, all while remaining to hold down that steady job. In many situations, remote work benefits all parties and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/larryalton\/2017\/03\/07\/are-remote-workers-more-productive-than-in-office-workers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">studies have shown<\/a> that productivity and performance increases when an employee works remotely.<br \/>\nIn fact, the ability to work remotely is starting to become a key factor for prospective talent in their decision to accept or reject a job. Companies such as Groove HQ and 10Up are almost fully remote, with all their employees located in different cities. Others, like Zapier,\u00a0are fully remote with team members working from all corners of the globe.<br \/>\nOf course, this comes with it challenges, including building a work culture that embraces remote work, but at the same time encourages accountability and commitment. Buffer pioneered the fully-remote trend in the tech space. Their blog, called <a href=\"https:\/\/open.buffer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Open Buffer<\/a>, espouses the benefits of a remote work structure.<br \/>\n\u201cThe thing about hiring people for a distributed team is that they need to be self-motivated and productive working at home, coffee shops or a co-working space\u201d, <a href=\"https:\/\/open.buffer.com\/distributed-team-benefits\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">writes<\/a> Joel Gascoigne, founder of Buffer. He goes on to\u00a0say that Buffer actually prefers to hire people who\u2019ve been freelancers or have worked at startups.<\/p>\n<h3>Demand for freelance talent is on the rise<\/h3>\n<p>Even at companies that aren\u2019t fully remote, the desire and, in some cases, need to find and hire freelance talent is gaining momentum. It is becoming increasingly common for big businesses to hire talent on an as needed basis for specific projects or initiatives that might require unique or specialized talent. FlexJobs, an online job portal for freelance, remote and flexible time work, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/in-demand-career-fields-freelancers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">released insights<\/a> last year that uncovered which major companies were hiring contract talent, and for which roles.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fbig-business-supporting-gig-economy%2F&#038;text=It%27s%20becoming%20increasingly%20common%20for%20big%20businesses%20to%20hire%20talent%20for%20specific%20projects%20or%20initiatives.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">It&#039;s becoming increasingly common for big businesses to hire talent for specific projects or initiatives.  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fbig-business-supporting-gig-economy%2F&#038;text=It%27s%20becoming%20increasingly%20common%20for%20big%20businesses%20to%20hire%20talent%20for%20specific%20projects%20or%20initiatives.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nPer the report,\u00a0Facebook was one of the top employers of\u00a0freelance talent. The Menlo Park-based tech giant\u00a0specifically sought out contractors for project management roles, such as product managers, sourcing managers and program managers. Media agency BBC Worldwide also hired in the same category.<br \/>\nIn healthcare, freelancers were being sought for positions such as clinical psychologist, medical coder and clinical nurse. In IT, companies like IBM and VMware were looking for contingent works to fill positions in web development, system administration and network engineering.<br \/>\nThe demand for freelancers is not just for entry level or dispensable positions either. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elainepofeldt\/2016\/06\/28\/will-your-next-boss-be-a-freelancer\/#7a7c2f436a18\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">survey<\/a> by Addison Group, a recruitment firm, revealed that 88 percent of hiring managers are more comfortable hiring contractual workers for senior level roles than they were five years ago.<\/p>\n<h3>Policies against moonlighting are being loosened<\/h3>\n<p>Two different reports by Adobe and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.careerbuilder.com\/share\/aboutus\/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?sd=9\/29\/2016&amp;siteid=cbpr&amp;sc_cmp1=cb_pr968_&amp;id=pr968&amp;ed=12\/31\/2016\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Career Builder<\/a> found that about 30 percent of U.S. workers hold two or more jobs. This number is higher in millennials, with over 44 percent of them holding multiple jobs. (You can check out more information on these &#8216;Slash Workers&#8217; from <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/slash-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s new study<\/a> on the future of independent work.)<br \/>\nInterestingly, workers are not pursuing these side hustles for the financial gains alone. While 88 percent of the respondent\u2019s to Adobe\u2019s study admitted that they were doing it for the money, 60 percent also said they were doing it for recognition and just over 50 percent \u00a0believed in the social impact their work had.<br \/>\nMoonlighting, or having a side business in addition to one&#8217;s &#8220;day job,&#8221; has historically been frowned upon by\u00a0employers who want talent fresh and focused.\u00a0But consider this: 78 percent of people\u00a0surveyed by Adobe believed that their side hustles made them more optimistic and happier.<br \/>\nEmployees who moonlight can be valuable assets to any company according to\u00a0Rosemary Haefner, the chief HR Officer at Career Builder. In Career Builder&#8217;s report, Haefner recommends workers pursue opportunities outside office hours because as entrepreneurs, these employees:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Gain skills off the clock:<\/em> Building your own business in your spare time gives you real world experience you can add to your resume and bring to your next job interview.<\/li>\n<li><em>Bring an entrepreneurial spirit to their jobs:<\/em> Employers are looking for entrepreneurial, proactive team members and self-starters to achieve organizational results.<\/li>\n<li><em>Boost creativity:<\/em> Entrepreneurial employees thrive when handed something to create.

However, for millennials, who make up the largest segment of the American workforce now, it may very well be the No. 1 benefit,\u00a0according to one\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pwc.com\/gx\/en\/managing-tomorrows-people\/future-of-work\/assets\/reshaping-the-workplace.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study<\/a>\u00a0fielded by PwC.<br \/>\nBig businesses realize this and are now giving more weightage to learning opportunities for their employees, even encouraging them to learn skills that may not be directed related to their\u00a0current role. Salesforce, for instance, has a system wherein employees and managers sit together and frame learning journeys that are designed to meet each individual employee\u2019s unique learning goals and needs.<br \/>\nFacebook has invested in continued learning by making on-demand classes available to its global workforce and offering career flexibility employees.<br \/>\nAs the freelance economy picks up steam, and evolves into a legitimate and sustainable career path for tens of millions of workers worldwide, big businesses are embracing its potential. For a\u00a0corporate world that is oftentimes shackled to legacy systems and complex machinations, this new talent pool offers fluidity, simplicity and the ability for big businesses to focus on results above all else.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Over 40% of the U.S. workforce has some side gig.
