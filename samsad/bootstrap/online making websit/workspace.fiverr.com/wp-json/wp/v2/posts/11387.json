But when you\u2019re just starting out and looking to&nbsp;acquire new clients, it can pay to look a little more sizeable.<br>Especially if you\u2019re going after bigger companies, looking credible and trustworthy is essential. A large business suggests a more successful business \u2013 and that translates to a safer option for your client.&nbsp;<br>Here are a few ways you can appear more professional even if you\u2019re just getting started.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Choose a business name<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you are working as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/case-studies-solopreneurs-with-successful-businesses\/\">solopreneur<\/a>, choose a professional business name to represent you. Brand this across everything you do (on invoices, email signatures, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=business-appear-bigger\">proposals<\/a>, for example).<br>Using a brand name from the beginning can set you up for future success. If you do grow to a size where you\u2019re hiring other employees, your brand name allows you to keep consistency across the clients you\u2019ve worked with from the outset.&nbsp;<br>Not sure where to start in choosing a name?&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillshare.com\/site\/join?teacherRef=8667770&amp;via=teacher-referral-partner&amp;utm_source=andco&amp;utm_medium=teacher-referral-partner&amp;utm_content=andco-0717&amp;t=Freelance-Fundmentals-How-to-Run-Your-Business-Learn-with-ANDCo&amp;sku=982384511\">This free freelance essentials course<\/a>&nbsp;can offer some tips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Have a professionally-designed website<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, you just can\u2019t get by without a good looking website. Even if it\u2019s just a one-pager, a professional site tells your prospects that you\u2019ve invested in your business and you know what you\u2019re doing. Your website is your first impression, so make it count.<br>A professionally-designed website that looks impressive doesn\u2019t have to be expensive.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr<\/a>&nbsp;is a great place to look for help if you don\u2019t have a big budget.<br>On your website, reference examples of previous clients you\u2019ve worked with, with testimonials if possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Grow your social media<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your online presence doesn\u2019t start and end with your website.<br>The popularity of social media means that potential clients are likely to go looking at your business pages on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram. Spending time creating and maintaining your social presence can be just as important as your website. Choose one or two platforms that are most relevant for you, and regularly post content that will attract the kinds of clients you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Choose a higher invoice number<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you send an invoice to your client with the number 1 or even 10, it screams loud and clear that you haven\u2019t been in business very long. Use a tool like&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=business-appear-bigger\">Fiverr Workspace for your invoicing<\/a>, and you can easily choose whichever number you like for your invoice \u2013 providing the impression that your business is much more seasoned.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Create professional contact details<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a separate work phone number. That way you can set up a professional business voicemail, and you can easily tell which calls are work-related and which are personal. And you don\u2019t necessarily have to get a separate phone for this \u2013 services like Google Voice or Hello Chava allow you to pick your area code and talk and text with clients just like a regular phone number.<br>You\u2019ll also need a work email address that looks professional. It\u2019s easy to add a second email address with most email providers. You could even set up addresses like&nbsp;<em>accounts@businessname.com&nbsp;<\/em>and&nbsp;<em>sales@businessname.com \u2013&nbsp;<\/em>no one needs to know that it\u2019s you replying to all of them!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Look the part<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While creating a more professional appearance can take some time (and maybe a little money), it\u2019ll be well worth the investment when you start to seamlessly win more projects. You may even create a self-fulfilling prophecy \u2013 and soon enough you won\u2019t have to&nbsp;<em>act<\/em>&nbsp;like you\u2019re big anymore.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Does size really matter?The answer is: it depends.There are many reasons why keeping your business small can be to your advantage \u2013 like your ability to<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":128,"featured_media":10636,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 -
