Not because of the Thanksgiving and some much needed time with family and friends, but because of all those \u201cyear in review\u201d lists. It\u2019s like the internet hands you all the news you missed over the past twelve months and you get to consume the best and worst of everything in a matter of weeks. We\u2019ve come to expect top picks for movies, music, literature. AND CO, being the dedicated freelance lifestyle guru that it is, is chipping in with a freelance year in review. A whole lot of awesome freelance-related stuff has gone down in 2016\u2014 and if the past is any indicator of the future, 2017 should be the year you go remote. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers Getting Paid. Justly.<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, \u00a0the freelancing life was frowned upon by disapproving parents, friends, and 9-to-5 bosses. It was an alternative working mode that lacked the reliability and pay of its more traditional cousin. \u201cFreelance\u201d evoked the image of a scrappy starving artist\u2014 for good reason. It was just so <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hard<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to be sure you\u2019d get paid fairly, if at all. Some clients would treat freelance work as disposable, leaving the individuals they hired high and dry. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But that\u2019s changing, as unions and progressive legislation are creating a more favorable climate for freelancing workers. Take New York City for example. Back in October, they became the first city to pass <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2016\/10\/27\/freelanceisntfreepassed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a law that penalizes client nonpayment<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. With 38% of the City\u2019s workforce freelancing, it only made sense that a law would come around to provide them labor rights and protections. \u00a0Freelancing is on the up, and it\u2019s not unrealistic to believe other cities will follow New York\u2019s example.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>There\u2019s a Whole Lot More of Us<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a previous post, we talked about several reasons Americans voted for the freelance lifestyle. One that stood out in particular? Cash. Student loans are no joke, and millennials living in cities are looking for ways to keep up with rising costs of living. Freelancing is providing a solution. If you\u2019re not ready to make the full-time jump to a freelancing lifestyle, you\u2019re not alone! Consider a\u00a0recent study by LinkedIn, which <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3065571\/the-future-of-work\/linkedin-data-shows-more-cash-strapped-millennials-turning-to-part-time-f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reveals a sharp rise<\/a> in the number of 9-to-5\u2019ers picking up some kind of side gig. Part of being your own boss often means setting your own prices, and if you need to scoop up some extra income then 2017 might just be the year of your side hustle.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>You Get to Live for You<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going remote is the ultimate New Year\u2019s resolution. Instead of chipping away at one bad habit (or your gut), you\u2019re giving your entire life an overhaul. You get to connect with what matters to you, in terms of work. By no means is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.careerfoundry.com\/career-change\/myths-freelance-lifestyle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freelancing\/remote work a walk in the park<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014 it requires incredible discipline, initiative, and resourcefulness. But it all becomes worth it once you realize how much time you\u2019ve saved by eliminating meetings, a commute, and a pointless banter with colleagues. <\/span>True, it&#8217;s a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/lindsey-kesel\/10-ways-freelance-life-is-different-than-a-day-job_b_7020054.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">major switch<\/a> for traditional workers, but there are plenty of resources out there to keep you afloat.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s Easier than Ever to Find Freelance Work<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seriously. Gone are the days of scouring job boards for a hopeful posting of freelance or remote opportunities. We\u2019re starting to see way more job boards and communities fully dedicated to the freelance life. Right here at AND CO, for instance, there\u2019s the blog you\u2019re reading right now <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a nice directory of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">platforms that are perfect for the freelance job search<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Whether you\u2019re a writer, marketer, or designer, there\u2019s bound to be a space on the internet dedicated to your professional niche.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m convinced that the end of the year is just about everyone&#8217;s favorite period of the calendar.
