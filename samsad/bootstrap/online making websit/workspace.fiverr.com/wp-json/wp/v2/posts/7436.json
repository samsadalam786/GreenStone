What Downtime?\u201d&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first response I received was from my friend Lexi who runs <a href=\"https:\/\/thewritelife.com\/\"><em>The Write Life<\/em><\/a>, a resource for freelance writers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNo downtime here. We have a 2- and 4-year-old home with us now. ALL THE TIME.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBoth my husband and I had to reduce expectations for our businesses since we&#8217;re splitting childcare hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI suppose our building for the future is teaching the kids about science and nature and baking and spelling and ensuring they feel loved and safe during an uncertain time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cBut for type-A entrepreneurs, it&#8217;s painful to not be able to follow through on business ambitions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I genuinely LOVE that the first response I received completely threw the entire premise of my question back in my face.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Taking care of YOU<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lexi wasn\u2019t the only one to remind me how important it is to find balance during this unprecedented time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend Ian Paget from <a href=\"https:\/\/logogeek.uk\/\"><em>LogoGeek<\/em><\/a> had this to say:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThe current situation is new for all of us&#8230;and it&#8217;s affecting everyone differently. Basic things like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/us\/blog\/the-gen-y-psy\/201810\/the-power-routines-in-your-mental-health\">keeping a routine can help [your mental health]<\/a>&#8211; waking up as you would normally, washing, getting changed, and going to bed at a normal time. Talking about how you feel is important too, and staying connected with friends and family. That should help to keep you positive and motivated.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Don&#8217;t feel like you need to use the &#8220;downtime&#8221; to cram your day with study, courses and work &#8211; it&#8217;s ok to stop and to look after yourself so you&#8217;re healthy and well for when the world returns to a more normal state.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel like you personally need to take time off to deal with what\u2019s happening, you\u2019re not alone. Chelsea Baldwin decided to regroup physically and emotionally before charging into what\u2019s next (and set up a free freelancer\u2019s summit to help you do the same):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cLike a lot of freelancers or agency owners, I saw my sales tank in March, and they haven&#8217;t fully recovered yet. I took some time off, doing the minimum to maintain my business while figuring out what to do or how to recover from the situation.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you read through some of the opportunities presented below, please keep in mind Lexi\u2019s wise thoughts and remember:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You don\u2019t have to be perfect.<\/li><li>You don\u2019t have to do everything right now.<\/li><li>There are other priorities in addition to your business.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With that important reminder, here are still a few motivational ways freelancers are using \u201cdowntime\u201d (if they have it) to grow their businesses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Building &amp; Nurturing Important Relationships<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When everything is running full-tilt, it can be easy to neglect important relationships with people both inside and outside of your business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But since <a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2014\/10\/the-freelance-economy-still-runs-on-word-of-mouth\">some studies have shown<\/a> \u201cword of mouth\u201d to be the top-performing marketing vehicle for as much as 84% of the world\u2019s 77 million freelancers, neglecting relationships can be deadly to your income.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why a lot of my friends recommended taking time to nurture and foster important relationships during COVID:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis is a great time to build your reputation and strengthen relationships.\u201d&nbsp; Jay Clouse from <a href=\"https:\/\/freelancing.school\">Freelancing School<\/a> shared with me.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dedicate a lot of time to reaching out to your advocates: your friends, family, clients, and collaborators. Ask them how they are doing, and listen to any problems they bring up.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you are able to help them, or introduce them to someone else who can, you&#8217;ll really build strong relationships.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking it a step further, Chelsea Baldwin agrees and adds encouragement to reach out to new people you\u2019d like to build a relationship with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cUse this opportunity (Covid) as a basis to reach out to new and interesting people you&#8217;ve always wanted to collaborate with, and introduce yourself.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Even if nothing comes out of it now, you never know what will happen in the future.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While networking and building relationships may not lead to immediate sales, it\u2019s still worth the effort in the long-term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cEven if people aren&#8217;t ready to buy right now,\u201d Clayton from <a href=\"https:\/\/freeup.net\">Freeup<\/a> reminded me, \u201cthey will remember you for what you do during this time. When the economies come back, you&#8217;ll be at the top of their list.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/adamwrightdesign.com\">Adam Wright<\/a> adds:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cAlthough [networking] doesn\u2019t produce fruit quickly, it\u2019s planting seeds for those who don\u2019t know about my business.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Growing an audience<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, networking and word-of-mouth marketing aren\u2019t the only ways to grow your business now and when COVID finally lets us all out of the house again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many freelancers and solopreneurs I spoke with are turning to the web to connect with more people (and often, more clients) by building some kind of audience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cDuring the quarantine I have been putting together an email list\u2014something that has been on my to-do list for years!\u201d explained Auni Milne, who runs her design company <a href=\"https:\/\/sumackloft.com\">Sumack Loft<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I launched an initiative reaching out to businesses in the community using my new email marketing knowledge and <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/how-to-offer-a-professional-discount-without-cheapening-your-services\">offered a discount via email<\/a> on design services for the month of April.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I have had three projects come out of it, providing me with more income than I might normally have had, while showing the business community that I care about their current challenges.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building an email list is just one of many ways you can engage with other people (and potential clients) online too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brentgalloway.me\">Brent Galloway<\/a>, who works primarily in the music industry, uses social media to get his brand in front of potential new clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve used the recent downtime to focus on creating content for my Instagram and YouTube channel.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>While there\u2019s potential for earning extra income through Google Adsense or affiliate links \u2013 the greatest benefit is the exposure it creates for my business.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>By creating content and sharing my design processes, I&#8217;m putting myself out there. It can be difficult, but creating content has been the most effective way to grow my brand and attract new freelance clients.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clayton Johnson is following suit:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cWe&#8217;re using this time to double down on helping people &amp; connecting with our audience with valuable content.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Everyone needs connection right now, so we&#8217;re running more webinars, writing more advice articles on what&#8217;s happening right now, and communicating more with clients directly.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Pitching New Clients (or Old Ones)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For many freelancers, they haven\u2019t used COVID-19 as an excuse to stop pitching clients. Reaching out via email or phone is still one of the most <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/how-to-get-freelance-clients\">common ways to find freelance clients<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>Many companies are trying to figure out how to navigate all the changes COVID-19 brings.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I am going through my client list and reaching out to previous ones to see if I can be of help right now. I hope to regain their business. I am also reaching out to current customers in the same way.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Lexie\u2019s not the only one that still sees pitching as a vital part of their freelance business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andy, a co-founder at <a href=\"https:\/\/harpoonapp.com\">Harpoon<\/a> gives this advice:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cTry offering your existing clients limited-time, reduced pricing on select services.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Even if you\u2019re \u201cmorally opposed\u201d to giving out discounts, these are unique times we\u2019re faced with, and reduced pricing might be just the incentive a client needs to loosen their budget a bit, converting your downtime into paid time.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might wonder who you can actually pitch to if <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/4-ways-to-build-passive-income-while-covid-has-your-clients-on-hold\">all your client budgets seem to be \u201con hold\u201d<\/a>. But Adam Wright is being smart on this one.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adam focuses on companies that seem to be thriving during the pandemic and he\u2019s focusing on the long-term potential his outreach can offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve been reaching out to businesses who aren\u2019t necessarily hurting as much right now, like landscaping &amp; lawn maintenance.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The idea is to do as much outreach right now with the hopes that they\u2019ll either 1) come back to me, and\/or 2) refer me to somebody they know that needs my services.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chelsea is also testing some unorthodox ways of reaching new clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m doing some low-cost marketing experiments I wouldn&#8217;t normally have the bandwidth to deal with. For example, yesterday I put up three ads on Craigslist to see what kind of traction I could gain there, and if I&#8217;d be able to turn that opportunity around into some quick cash. Each ad was $5, so it was only $15 to try out something new and a little unorthodox for me.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Go ahead and try some crazy marketing ideas that don&#8217;t cost much money. If they flop, they flop&#8230; but they probably won&#8217;t be total failures, and you&#8217;ll learn more about your business in the process.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diversifying Your Income<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find yourself a bit low on traditional client work, you may also want to consider finding new ways to <a href=\"https:\/\/skillcrush.com\/blog\/earn-more-money-freelancing-for-beginners\">make money as a freelancer<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s what a lot of the freelancers I talked to are doing, in fact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brent Galloway, who designs t-shirts for some of the biggest names in the music business, shares this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI use downtime during business hours to focus on passive income projects and tasks which help grow my brand.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Being a freelance graphic designer who creates merch for the music industry, I\u2019ve found success in selling digital assets.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Things like t-shirt mockups and texture packs. These are assets I need. And if I find value in them, then so could other designers.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And quite a few freelancers are turning to course creation to add a little extra revenue to the bottom line.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you create (or even take) <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/15-best-freelancing-courses-for-beginners\">courses for freelancers<\/a> or courses for your client base, course creation can represent a nice long-tail of revenue for months and years to come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve chosen to use some of the downtime to push myself hard to launch a course,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/mackeymedia.com\/\">Bobby Macey<\/a> shared with me.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI&#8217;ve wanted to have something that could provide passive income over time, and this was the perfect opportunity to build it.\u201d&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/freelancegrowthacademy.com\">Bruno Padilha<\/a> is doing the same thing\u2014utilizing this extra time to finally get to the courses he\u2019s been dreaming up in his mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI&#8217;m using this time to create content for 2 new online courses.
