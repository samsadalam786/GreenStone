Freelancers work without traditional protections such as paid sick leave and unemployment insurance, and are at a disproportionate risk of financial hardship. At the same time, they make up one-third of the U.S. workforce and contribute more than $1 trillion to the country\u2019s GDP. While we work toward securing government aid, freelancers\u2019 bills are due now. Rent, groceries, utilities \u2014 for those who live gig-to-gig, these necessities are at risk.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The Freelancers Union is encouraging anyone who has the means to donate, especially freelance platforms and companies working with freelancers. The goal is to raise enough money to offer financial assistance of up to $1,000 per freelance household to cover lost income and essential expenses not covered by government relief programs. Any freelancer who is experiencing sudden hardship \u2014 illness, lost work, or caregiving responsibilities \u2014 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic is eligible to apply for aid through the Fund.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>We know this isn\u2019t just affecting our community. It\u2019s also impacting millions of freelancers who work on other platforms and operate offline. We want you to know we\u2019re here to help, that\u2019s why  AND.CO and Fiverr are contributing to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/freelancersunion.org\/resources\/freelancers-relief-fund\">Freelancers Relief Fund<\/a>. 100% of the proceeds collected for the Freelancers Relief Fund will be distributed to freelancers in need. We wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without our incredible community, and we\u2019re here to offer support in any way we can during this difficult time.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the fund or are interested in applying, please visit the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/freelancersunion.org\/resources\/freelancers-relief-fund\">Freelancers Relief Fund
