There&#8217;s always another assignment to tackle, another client to reach out to, another email to send, another update that you&#8217;ve been meaning to make on your website\u2014the list is almost endless, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you should focus all your time and energy on your freelance business. You still need to lead a healthy and happy life.<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/tombarlow\/2011\/04\/15\/americans-cook-the-least-eat-the-fastest\/#6e7acd4e63ba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span>, among 34 western countries studied, the average time spent on meal preparation and cleanup per day was 2 hours and 8 minutes. In America, however, that time was only 30 minutes per day, but, <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/wonk\/wp\/2015\/04\/22\/youll-never-guess-the-worlds-fattest-country-and-no-its-not-the-u-s\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">with one of the highest obesity rates<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span> in the world, Americans pay the price for all that time-saving takeout and pre-packaged food.<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueapron.com\/market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Enter Blue Apron<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span>, a service that delivers healthful, seasonal, locally-sourced food, ready to cook at a reasonable price. No, it&#8217;s not as quick as a microwaved burrito, but it&#8217;s a good compromise between making everything from scratch and living off of frozen dinners\u2014you can still save yourself precious time while improving your health.<br \/>\nWith a 2-person or family plan available, Blue Apron gives customers options and <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/support.blueapron.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/203814526-Do-you-offer-vegetarian-options-\" rel=\"nofollow\">will even work to accommodate food preferences<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span> like vegetarianism. You can even customize your order based on those preferences.<br \/>\nFor a 2-person plan, meals come to $9.99 each, and for a family plan $8.74 each\u2014<span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueapron.com\/pages\/pricing\" rel=\"nofollow\">not much more<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span> than your favorite greasy combo meal. Blue Apron also makes skipping weeks easy, so when you&#8217;re on the road or when it&#8217;s the holiday season you won&#8217;t be receiving meals you don&#8217;t plan to eat.<br \/>\nFreelancers, as knowledge-based workers, should be concerned not only with their physical but their mental health (and both, of course, are intertwined). Being constantly busy, being stressed, sitting all day and staring at a computer screen, living off of junk food\u2014although this level of focus can make you a lot of money, it&#8217;s not an ideal way to live. Blue Apron allows you to take a few extra minutes to make a great meal, without having to fight through traffic to pick up that ingredient you forgot, and without having to do all of the prep work. It&#8217;s a great compromise for a busy freelancer.<br \/>\nThe <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueapron.com\/pages\/pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">menu is constantly changing<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span>, and features a wide variety of items\u2014from Thai to Italian to traditional American, there&#8217;s something for every taste. With their <span style=\"color: #000080;\"><span lang=\"zxx\"><u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.blueapron.com\/wine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">wine delivery service<\/a><\/u><\/span><\/span>, you can really give yourself a break at only $10 per bottle. Studies show that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2013\/02\/10\/opinion\/sunday\/relax-youll-be-more-productive.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">relaxation and vacations<\/a> can actually make you more productive, and increase the quality of your work.<br \/>\nBlue Apron serves not only as a means of delivering fresh food to you\u2014but also provides you with recipes, instructions, cookbooks, and much more through its website and <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/blue-apron-fresh-ingredients\/id976642810?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">its app<\/a>.
