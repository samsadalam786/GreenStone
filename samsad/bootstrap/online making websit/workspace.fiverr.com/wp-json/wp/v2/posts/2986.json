I\u2019m exhausted, sore, and well into a multi-day sore throat. So, my spirits are&#8230;not high.<br \/>\nI\u2019m usually better prepared than this. I have gotten my pre-trip routine down to a science, including a comprehensive packing list. But for this trip, a multi-day conference, I wildly underestimated what I would need to stay happy, healthy, and comfortable through long days and social nights. With South by Southwest on the horizon, I want better for myself\u2014and I want better for you, Dear Reader.<br \/>\nSo, inspired by my own \u201ccoulda packed, shoulda packed, woulda packed\u201d laments, I present to you my list of must-haves for the long haul in Austin.<\/p>\n<h3>Power Up: A multi-plug surge protector<\/h3>\n<p>It is a well-known architectural fact that there are never enough power outlets for all who need to charge their devices. And traveling with a phone, tablet, and computer often feels like making an impossible choice: who gets to live, and who gets to die?<br \/>\nMy solution: BYOPS (that is, bring your own power strip). This solves two problems for me: I get to make sure all my electronic children feel equally loved, and it makes me very popular in session rooms! As someone who sometimes struggles to get conversations started with new people, being able to offer their device a little bit of juice gets the job done with efficiency and a bit of altruism. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ikea.com\/us\/en\/catalog\/products\/70086401\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IKEA\u2019s KOPPLA 6-outlet strip<\/a> is my favorite, for their inexpensive nature and no-frills portability.<\/p>\n<h3>In The Air Tonight: A travel humidifier<\/h3>\n<p>Hotels and convention centers have two things in common: hideous taste in carpets, and dry, recycled air. The latter is undoubtedly the culprit for my raw and swollen throat today, and I refuse to suffer like this ever again. After consulting with several friends far smarter than me, I decided to add a travel humidifier to my arsenal. These devices, designed to add moisture to the air, will provide respite from the dryness that plagues not just Texas, but also the convention center halls and hotels we\u2019ll be frequenting day in and day out. As a bonus, many are able to operate with a standard 16.9 oz water bottle, making spills or water transfer unnecessary. The crowd favorite? Air Innovations\u2019 Compact Cool Mist model.<\/p>\n<h3>Fancy Feet: Insoles<\/h3>\n<p>Fitbit users rejoice: you will do ALL the walking during your time in Austin. Though the blocks are tightly packed, it might surprise you how those step numbers creep up over the course of each day. With that said, make sure you do it comfortably. Even with no preexisting foot issues, you\u2019ll benefit from a little extra cushion under your feet. Your best bet? Before you leave, find a Dr. Scholls Custom Fit kiosk near you and see which set will best fit your foot. While it won\u2019t combat all the fatigue you\u2019ll feel from pacing the streets of Austin, it\u2019s a step (I know, I know) in the right direction.<\/p>\n<h3>Little Pharma: Keep Austin Weird and Yourself Healthy<\/h3>\n<p>Finally, a few tips on pharmacy essentials to arm yourself with, just in case.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.emergenc.com\/products#original-formula\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Emergen-C:<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0The extra vitamin C never hurts when traveling, between the boost of energy and cold fighting properties. My power ranking of flavors could be a whole post unto itself, but I\u2019ll endorse Coconut-Pineapple and Pink Lemonade here.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tums.com\/antacid-products\/smoothies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tums<\/a>, Rolaids, or another antacid<\/strong>, because while man can live on tacos and BBQ alone, man\u2019s body might have something adverse to say about it. I\u2019m a sucker for the Assorted Fruit Smoothie flavor.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cvs.com\/shop\/health-medicine\/cough-cold-flu\/nasal-care\/cvs-saline-nasal-spray-prodid-891465\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Saline nasal spray<\/a><\/strong>: Seriously, recycled air is hard on your nose and throat. Protect yourself. The linked spray is TSA-compliant for carry-ons, but if you\u2019re checking a bag I\u2019d encourage you to level up.<\/li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.band-aid.com\/products\/for-kids\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Band-Aids<\/a><\/strong>: Blisters happen. Papercuts happen. Prepare accordingly and you (or someone you meet in need) won\u2019t be sorry! And while Band-Aid seems to equate \u201cdecorative\u201d bandages with bandages \u201cfor kids,\u201d I don\u2019t. Have fun!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>What other items are on your must pack list?
