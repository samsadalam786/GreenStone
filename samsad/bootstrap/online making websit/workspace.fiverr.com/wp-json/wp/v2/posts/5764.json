Self-employment means you\u2019re on your own when things get tough, and you may face challenges like navigating boundary issues and chasing past-due payments.<br>One way to make things a little less stressful &#8211; especially when it comes to getting what you&#8217;re owed &#8211; is to ensure you write a binding freelance contract. No matter your industry, a formal service agreement is essential to ensure a smooth working experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Never work without a contract<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of having a freelance contract are extensive. By defining the terms of the project, a formal service agreement will protect you from late payments, scope creep, and disagreements should any issues arise.<br>A solid freelance contract should outline the exact items you and the client expect from each other, and encourage a positive business relationship. Keep this in mind while you write your service agreement, and be sure to include <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/freelance-contract-clauses\/\">key information and clauses<\/a> such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Your rate or project fee, along with the scope of work (SOW)<\/li><li>A project timeline with milestones, deliverables, and revision limitations<\/li><li>A timeframe for how quickly the client must respond to your submission<\/li><li>Payment information, including details surrounding deposits and late fees<\/li><li>Termination and indemnity clauses\u2014that is, clauses that protect you in the event of a breach of contract or third-party litigation<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve gone over the importance of having a binding freelance contract, let\u2019s detail some strategies for writing an effective one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3 tips for writing a freelance contract<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not sure how to write a binding freelance contract? <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a> has you covered. In collaboration with Freelancers Union, we\u2019ve put together a freelance contract template independent contractors can use at their discretion. Using our template, you can quickly fill in the project timeframe and scope, along with your rate.<br>Whether you decide to use the template or not, keep in mind these three strategies for writing a strong freelance contract:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Use specific, quantitative language<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid being ambiguous in your freelance contract. Specificity will save you time and energy in the long run, so focus on those pesky details and make an effort to quantify your terms. You may include in your agreement: \u201cRate is set at $75 per hour, not to exceed 15 hours\u201d or \u201cTotal project cost is estimated at $1,250, not to exceed $1,500.\u201d This will protect you and the client from unwelcome surprises like endless revision requests and higher-than-expected invoices.<br>Similarly, rather than saying\u201cpayment is due at the end of the month\u201d, include something along the lines of: \u201cThe client will be invoiced on the last day of the month; net-30 payment terms apply. After a seven-day grace period, the client will incur a late fee equal to 15% of the amount owed.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Define the project scope (including what\u2019s out of scope)<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear communication is essential to any partnership. In your freelance contract, be sure to define the elements of service you will provide. Then, include a paragraph on those elements you will not provide.<br>Say you work as an editor, and offer both proofreading and copyediting services. If the client only requests proofreading but wants a more detailed edit, defining both services in your freelance contract will clarify the SOW and eliminate confusion before you get started on the project.<br>The same thing applies in other industries. Designers, for instance, should list the exact number of logo options they intend to deliver in their service agreement\u2014and all service providers should include how many revision requests they are willing to accommodate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>3. <\/strong><strong>Be concise and use bullet-points as needed<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve discussed the importance of being specific in your freelance contract. It may sound counterintuitive, but it\u2019s equally important to be concise.<br>This means you should steer clear of legal jargon, and instead write your freelance contract in <a href=\"https:\/\/plainlanguage.gov\/guidelines\/words\/avoid-jargon\/\">plain language<\/a>. Yes, you want to be thorough, but legalese\u2014and wordiness in general\u2014may bring confusion. Besides, terms like \u201chereafter\u201d and \u201ctherewith\u201d are archaic and unnecessary.<br>Say what needs to be said in as few words as possible. A sentence like: \u201cThe project will not take more than 30 hours to complete\u201d can easily be summarized as \u201cProject not to exceed 30 hours.\u201d Pay close attention to formatting as well, use bullet-points as needed, and focus on clarity above all else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Need help getting started?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We said it before, but it&#8217;s important enough to say again: <em>never work without a contract.<\/em> If you&#8217;re having trouble getting started, give Fiverr Workspace a try.<br>Using a standardized contract vetted by a third party eliminates back and forth, establishes trust, and speeds up the signing process.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As a freelancer, you likely enjoy flexible hours and tackle a variety of projects.But a lot goes on behind the scenes.
