Your inner creative genius is in hiding, your canvas remains blank and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a solution on the horizon. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And we creatives tend to be hard on ourselves. We take our lulls quite personally, convincing ourselves that they\u2019re a sign that we\u2019re not good enough for the project or that we\u2019ll never be able to come up with something new again. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But before you throw in the towel, stop, breathe, and remember that this is only temporary. You\u2019ve made miraculous creative comebacks before, and you\u2019ll do it again. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You just need a few strategies to help you. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe that <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.vujadeview.com\/where-does-creativity-come-from\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">creativity comes from the right combination of two things.<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is all of the experiences, knowledge, and examples you have to draw on for inspiration; your seeds of stimulation that could one day blossom into a brainwave. The second is allowing your mind time to be idle. By moving away from the problem at hand, you give yourself the space to let your collective, seemingly unrelated stimuli bubble up into fresh ideas. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With that in mind, here are 10 strategies that serve to fill up your tank or create a little space. Use them to turn your breakdown into a breakthrough.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>1. Search for inspiration<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Good news\u2014surfing the internet can actually be productive! When inspiration doesn\u2019t seem to be coming to you, go looking for it. Whatever you\u2019re working on, something similar has been done before. Look for examples that other people have created, or research the topic to arm yourself with more information. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea here is not to copy what you find\u2026 It\u2019s simply to get your brain thinking about the subject and how it\u2019s been approached before so that you can come up with your own unique perspective. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>2. Go for a walk<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes it can feel like you don\u2019t have time for a break, but chances are, if you\u2019re in a lull, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve earned one. A creative interlude may be a signal that you need to conserve or replenish your physical and psychological energy so you can think more clearly. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideas often come to us in the moments we least expect them to, when we\u2019ve stopped focusing on the problem and our subconscious brain is able take over. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walking can help to coerce these moments. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.apa.org\/pubs\/journals\/releases\/xlm-a0036577.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers at Stanford University<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> examined the level of creativity in people while they walked compared to while they sat, and found that a person&#8217;s creative output increased by an average of 60 percent when walking. They also discovered that walking was most beneficial for tasks that required a fresh perspective (rather than tasks that need a single answer). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give yourself permission to step away from your work and take a walk. Along the way, allow your brain the space to tinker around with ideas, so you have a chance of connecting previously unconnected dots.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>3. Sweat it out<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other forms of exercise can also be a great way to make a break from work feel productive. And it\u2019s amazing how when you get your blood flowing, ideas often flow more freely too. A<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s well as reducing stress, helping you to focus, increasing productivity, and enhancing your memory, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/exercise-benefits-brain-creativity-stress-2016-11\">there\u2019s evidence supporting<\/a> the idea that exercise could make us more creative. Strap on the running shoes or make time for a yoga class and you could start seeing the benefits in your work.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>4. Get a change of scenery<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re a freelancer, chances are you\u2019re lucky enough to be able to work from anywhere. Take advantage of this by changing up your workspace. Work from a park, a cafe, or a cabin in the woods\u2014anything that gets you out of your routine and into a new location could fuel some inspiration. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bonus points if you can find some blue scenery; a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2009\/02\/090205142143.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">study at the University of British Columbia<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that blue, which is often associated with peaceful environments like the ocean, allows people to relax and feel more comfortable creating. Participants in the study produced twice as many creative results when looking at something blue as they did when looking at something red.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>5. Review examples of your creative genius<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing slams the breaks on the creativity train like the fear that you\u2019re not good enough. If you think this might be the cause of your lull, it may help to review some of your best work. Create a swipe file of your proudest creations or positive feedback from clients. Review it in times when you feel like you\u2019re not good enough to remind you that this is but a temporary pause.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>6. Learn something new<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always wondered <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/diy_neuroscience_that_annoying_buzzing_may_be_a_love_song\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">why mosquitoes buzz<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/lera_boroditsky_how_language_shapes_the_way_we_think\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how language shapes the way we think<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? Now is your chance to spend a little time watching TED talks or listening to podcasts on topics completely unrelated to your project. Sometimes soaking up knowledge about anything at all can allow you to see things from a fresh perspective. <\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/scan\/article\/10\/2\/191\/1652873\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A study<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that the part of what makes someone creative is \u201cconceptual integration\u201d\u2014the ability to blend information from various scenarios and experiences and understand complex comparisons. So while your educational interval may not provide you with the answer to your current problem, what you learn could help you be more creative in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>7. Talk to someone<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discussing an idea is one of the best ways to come up with new solutions. If you\u2019re a freelancer or solopreneur this can be tough, since you miss out on the water cooler chat of the office environment. Find a way to talk to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-you-need-freelance-community\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">other freelancers in your network<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, to your family and friends, or to your pet\u2014it doesn\u2019t much matter who it is, it\u2019s more about the process of talking through your ideas. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>8. Add some background noise<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Researchers at the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/news.illinois.edu\/view\/6367\/205068\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">University of Illinois<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> found that a little background noise can help increase your creative output, providing a great excuse to pump your favorite tunes while you work. Just don\u2019t play them too loud; researcher Ravi Mehta says around 70 decibels is the sweet spot.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cIf you go beyond that, it&#8217;s too loud, and the noise starts to negatively affect creativity. It&#8217;s the Goldilocks principle\u2014the middle is just right.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>9. Just keep working<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a writer, I regularly think about this quote from author Jodi Picoult: <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou might not write well every day, but you can always edit a bad page. You can&#8217;t edit a blank page.\u201d <\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s easy to think, \u2018I\u2019m not feeling creative enough today, I\u2019ll work on this later\u2019. But that can quickly spiral into a regular thing and suddenly you\u2019re achieving nothing. Some days you just need to grit your teeth and keep working through your creative block. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try free writing, drawing, or creating; just get all of your ideas out without expecting anything to be perfect first go. The point is that you are creating\u2014and you can go back and make edits later.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>10. Get something else done<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If all else fails, use the time to get on with something else that needs doing. Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/guide\">invoicing your client<\/a> or pitching for a new gig, you\u2019ll feel good that you\u2019ve used your down time productively and ticked off some of your other priorities. <\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tip: You can make this time even more productive with <\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\">Fiverr Workspace\u2019s invoicing software,<\/a> which<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> allows you to create invoices in less than 10 seconds. <\/span><\/i><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Stuck in a lull?
