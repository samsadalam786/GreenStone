Broadening your skillset, conquering challenges, and expanding your horizons are all exciting benefits that go along with trying your hand at something that\u2019s totally foreign to you.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, it wasn\u2019t always so easy to get access to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tools-resources-for-freelancers\/\">the resources you needed<\/a> to take on a new project. In fact, in the past, you were pretty limited\u2014unless you could find a class at local community center or college or a step-by-step book detailing what you needed to know, you were pretty much left to your own devices.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, this is just another one of those ways technology (mainly, the internet) has been able to swoop in and vastly improve all of our lives. Now, we have sites just like <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillshare.com\/?via=header\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skillshare<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that not only make trying something new totally accessible\u2014but incredibly rewarding too.<\/span><br \/>\nTry this: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/free-freelance-essentials-course-your-complete-guide-from-contracts-to-taxes\/\"><em>Free Freelance Essentials Course: Your Complete Guide from Contracts to Taxes<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h2>What is Skillshare?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose behind Skillshare is simple: It\u2019s an online learning community for creators (or, really anyone who wants to <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">become<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> a creator). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a Skillshare member, you\u2019ll have access to thousands of videos from real people that will teach you something new\u2014or help you refine a skill or craft you already have.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vast majority of the classes are taught in bite-sized videos\u2014seriously, an average class is 10-25 minutes long, which is then broken down into even smaller videos. So, learning something new is completely manageable. As a matter of fact, you could realistically pick up a new skill each and every day. What could be better than that? <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What sorts of classes can I take?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of great things about Skillshare. But, one of the best has to be the variety of classes offered. Skillshare knows that creators aren\u2019t<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> just<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> artists\u2014no, there are makers and creators in nearly every single industry.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you want to know more about design and photography, email marketing and business modeling, cooking or productivity, you\u2019ll find a little bit of everything on Skillshare. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who teaches the classes?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you\u2019re thinking about taking a class, but you want to know who you\u2019ll be learning from. Well, if you\u2019re picturing some dry, out-of-touch professor in a stuffy three-piece suit, think again.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is one of the coolest parts about Skillshare: Teachers are real people (just like you and me) who are really awesome at something\u2014and they want to help you become awesome at it too.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Professionals, freelancers, students\u2014they\u2019re all eligible to teach on Skillshare, as long as the skill they\u2019re aiming to teach meets the guidelines. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No degree requirements and no red tape. Just learning new skills straight from the people who really do them best. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s the benefit?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, we think the main benefit is obvious: You\u2019ll get to expand your skillset in a way that\u2019s both engaging and fun.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, if that\u2019s not enough to have you singing Skillshare\u2019s praises quite yet, how about this? Every single class includes a class project\u2014an assignment you\u2019ll complete using the skills you just learned. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That means you\u2019ll not only actually get to try out your new skill, you\u2019ll also end the class with a real piece that you can use to start your portfolio, hang on your refrigerator, or share with your friends and family. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Skillshare, you\u2019re not just learning\u2014you\u2019re <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">doing<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Alright, so how much does it cost?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This all sounds pretty great, right? And, if you\u2019re getting ready to hand over an arm and a leg in order to cover the inevitably high membership fees, we can\u2019t blame you. But, stop right there.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skillshare is incredibly affordable\u2014there\u2019s even a free membership. Yes, you read that right: Totally free. With that membership level, you\u2019ll gain access to 754 classes, their awesome community of creators, and the app so that you can learn on the go.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Want to kick things up a notch? You can do so\u2014without the hefty price tag. Skillshare Premium is just $12 per month (with additional savings with an annual plan), and you\u2019ll have thousands of classes (7,500 of them, to be exact) at your fingertips. Even better? The premium membership gets you offline access, meaning you can pick up a new skill literally anywhere.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, learning a new skill should be fun and exciting\u2014not overwhelming and stressful. So, if you\u2019re ready to try your hand at something new, go ahead and give Skillshare a try. We promise, you won\u2019t be disappointed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Members can get 3 months of Skillshare for only $.99!<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who doesn\u2019t love learning something new?
