Here are some reasons why freelancers should (and deserve!) to celebrate long weekends just like the rest of the workforce. After all, you work <i>unconventional<\/i> hours all week long, isn\u2019t it time you did something <i>conventional<\/i>?<\/p>\n<h2><b>Give Yourself A Break!<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to justify giving yourself a day off when you\u2019re the boss. After all, you don\u2019t want to seem like you\u2019re giving one employee special treatment, even if it is just you! But it\u2019s important not to wear yourself out working long hours. Everyone knows that taking a break from work helps to keep you healthy and focussed! If you insist on\u00a0being the CEO, CFO and the receptionist, then you have to be HR as well. Give yourself a break. Literally. Knock on your own office door, ask to see the boss (you) and tell them you\u2019re off to enjoy some <a href=\"https:\/\/www.opentable.com\/m\/best-brunch-restaurants-in-america-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Labor Day brunch specials<\/a>!<\/p>\n<h2><b>See How The Other Half Lives<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/explore\/tags\/9to5\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#9to5<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/desklunch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#desklunch<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=hump%20day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#humpday<\/a>\u2026 these are the hashtags that the \u2018other half\u2019 of the workforce use daily. Strange, we know. While you might find a 9-5 work day unappealing, no one can argue with the 4-day weekends that the \u2018other half\u2019 get to celebrate during national holidays. Luckily, as a freelancer, you can join in, without having to use any annoying hashtags.\u00a0Grab a few drinks, bake a casserole and head to your neighbor\u2019s Labor Day party like it\u2019s 4:45pm on a Friday!<\/p>\n<h2><b>Guilt-Free Monday Nights\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>When you already have a flexible schedule, taking a Monday off of work isn&#8217;t always as exciting. But just think, if you head to your friend&#8217;s Labor Day party on a Monday night, you&#8217;ll be the only one in the room not cringing at the thought of an early <a href=\"https:\/\/9gag.com\/gag\/aYemx90\/monday-morning-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tuesday morning<\/a> back in the office. Just flex that flexible schedule, move a few work projects to the Friday before, and enjoy your 4-day weekend without the painful Tuesday morning!<\/p>\n<h2><b>Every Penny Counts\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>We understand that turning down work can be tough, especially when you\u2019re the only one pulling in new clients, and you can\u2019t rely on your <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/cat-animation-vintage-W7FzxqyWHVvdS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fish Herb<\/a> to chip in with the rent. But what\u2019s the point of working on a Sunday if you can\u2019t spend that extra cash on some turkey dogs on a Monday? Work hard the week before, save up those pennies, and take the weekend off with everyone else. Now that\u2019s logic even\u00a0your wallet\u00a0can\u2019t argue with.<\/p>\n<h2><b>This Labor Day, Just Say Yes<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Freelancers work hard to find and keep clients, hardly ever saying \u2018no\u2019 to work that comes across their desks. This \u2018yes please\u2019 attitude can lead to you working 3 extra days on a client\u2019s presentation because they keep sending you endless add-ons\u00a0that were not laid out in the original agreement. We\u2019re not telling you to start saying \u2018no\u2019 to work, we\u2019re telling you to starting saying\u00a0YES to long weekends as a reward for all of the 12 hour workdays you do without batting an eyelid! Go finish that never-ending project, turn on your Out Of Office and enjoy the fruits of your LABOR!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Just because you don\u2019t work typical office hours or\u00a0gossip by the water cooler doesn\u2019t mean your work isn\u2019t still classified as \u2018labor.\u2019 So clock-out, sit back,<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":45,"featured_media":7689,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>This Labor Day, Take The Day Off!<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"It\u2019s important not to wear yourself out working long hours.
