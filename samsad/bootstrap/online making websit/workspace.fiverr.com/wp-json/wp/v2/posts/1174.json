So get out of the wings and get under those lights!<\/p>\n<h2>YES AND (CO)!<\/h2>\n<p>Agree and add information! This famous rule in improv doesn\u2019t only apply to the stage. Working with your client\u2019s ideas and input is crucial in producing top-notch work, even if they don&#8217;t let you be funny in the process. If a client sends you a few of their own designs for their&nbsp;website\u2019s landing page, don\u2019t shut them down, say YES to their input, AND add your own professional tweaks as well! When it comes time to use your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace invoice app<\/a> that month you\u2019ll be saying YES, Fiverr Workspace all the way to the bank!<\/p>\n<h2>Think On Your Feet<\/h2>\n<p>When a project is coming to an end and a client is emailing you with endless edits and updates, you\u2019ve got to move fast and come up with effective solutions. Being able to&nbsp;roll with whatever your scene partner throws at you during an improv will DEFINITELY come in handy when the <i>going gets tough <\/i>in the office. Head down to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.groundlings.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Groundlings<\/a>, take a few improv classes and you\u2019ll soon feel invincible!<\/p>\n<h2>Who, What, Where.<\/h2>\n<p>The first few moments of an Improv are crucial. You\u2019ve got to establish&nbsp;the \u2018who\u2019, \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018where\u2019 of the scene quickly&nbsp;so the audience knows what&#8217;s going on. This also applies to the world of freelancing. When you take on a new client, it\u2019s important to make sure they, and you, understand the project, the schedule, and whether you\u2019ll be working remotely or from an office. Once you\u2019ve clarified&nbsp;these details, you can get back to updating your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace expense tracking app<\/a> and claim a few donuts for all of your hard work!<\/p>\n<h2>People Skills Freelancers Need<\/h2>\n<p>Freelancing can mean working with a variety of different people and personalities. It can be intimidating dealing with demanding clients, or even giving monthly updates on&nbsp;pivotal conference calls. But once you stand on a stage in front of 50 strangers and make up a scene about spicy dumplings, nothing seems that scary anymore! You\u2019ll start to wonder why you were so shy in the first place. Track all of those hours you\u2019ve spent being the life and soul of the party with the <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace time tracking app<\/a> and enjoy the encore!<\/p>\n<h2>I\u2019ve Got Your Back!<\/h2>\n<p>The best rule in improv: Everyone on stage has your back. No matter how badly a scene is going, or how terrible your joke about turtle racing was, your scene partner will be there to help you! The improvisers at UCB (Uprights Citizens Brigade) couldn\u2019t do what they do without the support of their cast. If a client is getting worried about an upcoming deadline, or a fellow freelancer needs a last minute favor to help secure an account, you\u2018ll have their back! Because if we\u2019re there for each other, we can achieve great things, and those jokes about turtles can be turned into comedy gold!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freelancing is a lot like improv, you have to think on your feet and you have to listen to the audience (otherwise known as, your client!)&nbsp;Whether<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":45,"featured_media":7874,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16,17],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How Improv Comedy Helps a Freelance Career<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Even if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re a comedic person, you can still make work funny and improve your business acumen!
