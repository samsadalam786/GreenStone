The generosity!<br \/>\nEven the great Bill Gates has his routine, reportedly staying up late the night before a big negotiation, wrapped in a baby-blue Snuggie, binge-watching episodes of \u201cThe Closer.\u201d<br \/>\n(Ok, the last one&#8217;s made up, but you\u2019re welcome for the image.)<br \/>\nBefore starting on these Jedi-level, grade-A shenanigans, you\u2019ve got to learn the basics. That\u2019s what this list is for. Think of it like a packing list, except the only things included are shoes, underwear, and a toothbrush. This list is the thin fig-leaf just about keeping your negotiating-dignity intact. Let\u2019s get after it.<\/p>\n<h3>Identify your \u2018Walk Away Point\u2019 (WAP)<\/h3>\n<p>How about some acronyms? WAP is lovingly referred to as \u201cBATNA\u201d by people who go to Cartagena for the weekend to binge-drink, AKA MBAs. BATNA is an abbreviation for the wonderfully jargony term\u00a0\u201cBest Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement\u201d and is essentially a fancy way of describing the point at which you should walk away from a deal.<br \/>\nWe\u2019re starting with WAP because identifying it is the FIRST\u2014and most important\u2014thing you should do prior to entering a negotiation. Highlight this, underline it, heck, tweet it. It\u2019s a biggie.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=The%20first%20rule%20of%20%23negotiation%3A%20Always%20know%20your%20WAP%20%28Walk-Away-Point%29.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The first rule of #negotiation: Always know your WAP (Walk-Away-Point).  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=The%20first%20rule%20of%20%23negotiation%3A%20Always%20know%20your%20WAP%20%28Walk-Away-Point%29.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nYou know that feeling when you\u2019re right in the middle of a raging, incoherent fight with your sig other and you suddenly can\u2019t remember what you\u2019re yelling about? This is the type of situation you want to avoid when negotiating, and it\u2019s something that <em>can<\/em> be avoided by identifying your WAP.<br \/>\nWithout a WAP, negotiators tend to talk in circles, losing track of what really matters, and potentially even agreeing to something you wish you hadn\u2019t. Save yourself the hassle by knowing when to walk away.<\/p>\n<h3>Have a listen first<\/h3>\n<p>There\u2019s plenty of theory around whether it\u2019s strategically better to open a negotiation or \u201cforce\u201d the other person to do so. I think it\u2019s a wash, and more importantly, there are significantly more useful things to focus on as you get started. Namely, the other person.<br \/>\nEncouraging the other person to share their needs and hopes achieves a few things: it shows an interest in fulfilling their goals, demonstrates empathy, and frames the discussion as a potentially positive experience for both parties.<br \/>\nTry it out. Put yourself in the other party\u2019s shoes and make an honest effort to understand their end game before you dive into pushing your own agenda.<\/p>\n<h3>Now, drop the anchor<\/h3>\n<p>Whether you go first or second, at some point you\u2019re going to have to drop the anchor. This is the moment where you share your first offer, which is psychologically likely to strongly influence the range in which the negotiation is conducted.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s important to choose your starting point carefully, beginning with a reasonable offer\u2014that is, within the realm of possibility\u2014otherwise, you risk losing the person\u2019s trust. At the same time, keep in mind that your initial offer should give you plenty of space to move. If you will pay no more than $10 for a hamburger, don\u2019t open at $9.<br \/>\nAnother pro-tip here is to focus on your own offer. Do not get stuck in your own mind as you try to guess the other person\u2019s anticipated anchor. If you find yourself getting carried away, refer to your WAP and compare. It\u2019s your true North.<\/p>\n<h3>Use integrative bargaining<\/h3>\n<p>This is a way of \u201cexpanding the pie,\u201d so to speak, or adding to the issues being debated. This is a powerful, constructive tool, as it essentially increases the chance of a \u201cwin-win\u201d negotiation being undertaken.<br \/>\nWhen it comes to integrative bargaining, our second point around listening comes to play in a big way. By collecting information and demonstrating empathy early on, you\u2019ll set yourself up for more opportunities for integrative bargain down the line.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=In%20%23business%2C%20integrative%20bargaining%20starts%20with%20empathy.%20Expand%20the%20pie%20of%20any%20negotiation%20by%20listening.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In #business, integrative bargaining starts with empathy. Expand the pie of any negotiation by listening. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=In%20%23business%2C%20integrative%20bargaining%20starts%20with%20empathy.%20Expand%20the%20pie%20of%20any%20negotiation%20by%20listening.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nHow does this work? Discussing multiple issues allows for prioritization. Providing the negotiating parties prioritize different issues differently, we should be able to both get more of what we want by giving more of what don\u2019t. We\u2019ll get into this further a couple points down.<\/p>\n<h3>Explain yourself<\/h3>\n<p>Just as it\u2019s a good idea to listen to the other person\u2019s goals, returning the courtesy can help move things forward, providing you\u2019re genuine about it. If you sincerely express your priorities and explain why they\u2019re important to you, your actions become considerably less arbitrary and easier to get onboard with.<br \/>\nFor example, if you tell me that you can&#8217;t sell me your car before March because you promised to lend it to your buddy for a road trip, I&#8217;m likely to find you a lot more agreeable, and a lot less stubborn than if you just told me I simply can&#8217;t have it for another couple of weeks.<\/p>\n<h3>It\u2019s not about #Winning<\/h3>\n<p>If you go into a negotiation thinking there can only be one winner, there\u2019s a good chance you are (or will be) the type of parent that ruthlessly massacres their child at a shared sporting endeavor just so they \u201clearn how to lose.\u201d According to my therapist, that approach doesn\u2019t help anyone.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s also not true! Taking a zero-sum approach to negotiating is at once destructive and blinding. Negotiations should be beneficial to both parties: after all, that\u2019s the whole point. The only reason we negotiate is because we think, at some level, that we might do better together than apart.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=The%20reason%20we%20%23negotiate%20is%20because%20we%20think%20that%20we%20might%20do%20better%20together%20than%20we%20would%20apart.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The reason we #negotiate is because we think that we might do better together than we would apart. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnegotiaton-tips-entrepreneurs-freelancers%2F&#038;text=The%20reason%20we%20%23negotiate%20is%20because%20we%20think%20that%20we%20might%20do%20better%20together%20than%20we%20would%20apart.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nHere\u2019s a metaphor someone relayed to me recently: imagine you and I both want the same orange. It\u2019s on the table right in front of us, it\u2019s waxy skin grinning in the light. For an hour or so, we squabble over who should get it. Eventually, you\u2019re relentless, badgering, overpowering; I succumb. You walk away with your orange in hand, I walk away with nothing and hope to never negotiate with you again.<br \/>\nImagine another scenario: the orange is still on the table right in front of us. Only this time, you ask me why I want the orange and how I can help. I tell you I want the seeds, since I want to use a couple to grow my own trees. I return the favor, finding out what you\u2019re looking for. To my surprise, you only want the juice\u2014ha! This is perfect integrative bargaining in action and we have both just \u201cwon.\u201d We high-five in excitement. In a little less than five minutes, you have a glass of juice, and I have the seeds that I will watch do nothing in the little ceramic full of dirt on my windowsill.<br \/>\nSo there you have it\u2014the quick and dirty guide to negotiation.
