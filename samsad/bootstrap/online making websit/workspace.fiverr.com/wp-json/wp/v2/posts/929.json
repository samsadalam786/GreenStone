But with all of the flexibility comes the reality that work might not always be as regular as we would like. While we all go through these cold periods, you don\u2019t need to roll over and cry your eyes out because of a slow month. Before the bracing cold, take these preventative measures so that your lean season won\u2019t sideline you indefinitely.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Set Up a Savings Account<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stowing away your funds in a savings account isn\u2019t just a good move for freelancing cold periods. It\u2019s a good life move in general. Getting your savings started is as simple as walking into your bank and saying, \u201chey, yeah let\u2019s get this savings account set up\u201d, but with some research, you can make that account work for you. Don\u2019t get a savings account that\u2019s practically a grave for your funds, because the last thing you want to see is zero growth from all the money you\u2019re conscientiously stowing away. So be sure to look out for a high yield savings account\u2014 a decent APY could net you a nice chunk of cash after the year is over. And if you\u2019re super-ambitious, join a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mycreditunion.gov\/about-credit-unions\/pages\/how-is-a-credit-union-different-than-a-bank.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">credit union<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The big difference between credit unions and banks is that the former is not-for-profit, but the latter pays back out to shareholders. As a credit union member, you\u2019re a part owner. Which means that profits are kicked back to you via attractive savings rates and loan rates. It may not be the sexiest option, but getting your bank accounts in line should be the first step to weather any financial storm.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Passive Income Streams for Freelancers<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Taking advantage of passive income opportunities isn\u2019t an instantly attractive course of action, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Like the returns from a solid savings account, you won\u2019t be lining your pockets with passive income every month. But if you get the wheels turning on enough of these streams and those small gains start to add up. You also have no excuse because all the effort comes in signing up. The point is that it&#8217;s passive income\u2014 so you\u2019re not worrying about deadlines or assignments. You\u2019re doing next to nothing. There&#8217;re loads of apps out there that you can install that will keep the greenbacks coming in. A popular one is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.swagbucks.com\/?cmp=720&amp;lp=2028&amp;postRegUrl=surveys&amp;utm_term=175221&amp;cxid=0-175221&amp;utm_source=175221&amp;aff_sid=&amp;utm_campaign=133&amp;utm_medium=cpa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Swagbucks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, which pays you for taking short surveys. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mypoints.com\/emp\/u\/index.vm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">MyPoints<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> is another worth checking out; it gives you cashback for shopping at online retailers like Amazon and Target!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Active Income Streams for Freelancers<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">While your passive income streams are giving you a few extra bucks a month, kick it up a notch and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/272837\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">start a side hustle<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. The upside to a part-time gig is that you\u2019ll most likely be doing something that you love. Fancy yourself a writer? Work towards contributor status on a burgeoning blog. Like to cook? Instead of going out to eat, act the chef or restaurateur for a group of friends. Depending on how labor intensive your projects are, your gig can fit seamlessly into your schedule and you can work on it when you get the chance. And who knows, maybe it will unexpectedly take off and you\u2019ll have your very own small business on your hands.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Sublet and Move Home<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This isn\u2019t an option for everyone, but if you can make it work you definitely should give it a go. When you\u2019re freelance projects don\u2019t involve face-to-face client interactions, then perhaps you should try to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.airbnb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Airbnb<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> your spot and ask your parents if you can head back home to crash for a while. Even if family won\u2019t let you live rent free, you still might get a steep discount. And in the event that you\u2019re paying full price, that rent could be crumbs compared to what you\u2019re paying in a high-cost city like New York or San Francisco. True, it\u2019s not the best thing for your social life. But there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking a step back and getting your life back in order. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Reassess Your Subscription Services<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In trying to cut the cord, your pile of subscriptions could sabotage your money saving plan. Instead of paying for a full cable package, you signed up for Netflix at $8. But you realize they don\u2019t have your favorite TV offerings, so you need Hulu as well. And you\u2019re hearing good reviews about that new show that somehow got picked up exclusively by Amazon, so you plunk down a fat Franklin for an annual service. And <em>Game of Thrones<\/em>\u00a0is coming back? Better take advantage of HBO\u2019s subscription service. Add it all up, and you\u2019re saddled with bills that could go towards debt payments or groceries. And that\u2019s before you start accounting for music services, cooking subscriptions, magazines, or snack deliveries.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here\u2019s how you can stop hemorrhaging money. Pick only one or two services that are super-important to you, and then collaborate. Maybe you keep your Netflix and another friend keeps Hulu. You\u2019re getting all of your friends to save money while encouraging IRL interactions. That\u2019s a beautiful thing. It works for music too. Don\u2019t pay for Apple music. Suggest a Frank Ocean Listening party, then return the favor the next time some crazy botched release is exclusively streaming on TIDAL or Spotify. And for those food services? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/cooking.nytimes.com\/learn-to-cook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Learn to cook<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u2014 it\u2019s way more fun than you\u2019d think.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The freelance lifestyle is an attractive one.
