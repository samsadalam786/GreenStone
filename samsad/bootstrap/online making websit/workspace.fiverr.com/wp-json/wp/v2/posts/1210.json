A freelancer wants to work with the best clients but, unfortunately, trying to filter out the pesky clients from\u00a0the good ones can make this process even harder.<br \/>\nPesky clients are hard to spot and can sneak up on you like your 30th birthday. Here\u2019s the good news: we\u2019ve put together a list of five tell-tale signs that you&#8217;re dealing with a pesky freelance client\u00a0so you can avoid them in the future:<\/p>\n<h2>Ghosting on a Freelancer is Not Cool<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>When you\u2019ve got a deadline approaching and you need crucial information from your client, the last thing you need is for them to be MIA. We get it, everyone is busy, but so are you! Part of what makes the relationship between freelancer and client productive, is <i>communication<\/i>. If your text message bubbles are all blue then you\u00a0might want to rethink whether this client is worth all the silence!<\/p>\n<h2>Guilt Tripping a Freelancer? Nah.<\/h2>\n<p>If your client spends more time telling you how they can\u2019t afford you rather than giving you work assignments, then you might have a pesky freelance client on your hands. No one wants to be guilt tripped into giving free services, and because freelancers work for themselves, some clients think they can guilt trip you into lowering your costs. Stick to your guns, you provide a unique service and you deserve to be paid for it. Nobody puts baby in a corner!<\/p>\n<h2>A Side Order Of Fries<\/h2>\n<p>Getting a clear outline for a project is a gift! But having a client throw you extra work that was not outlined in the original freelance agreement can leave a bad taste in your mouth! If you\u2019ve found yourself at the end of an assignment with more last-minute \u2018add-ons\u2019 than a Sprint\u00a0phone\u00a0plan, you\u2019re in the presence of a pesky client!<\/p>\n<h2>Backseat Driver<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Most clients hire a freelancer because they don\u2019t have time to do the work themselves, or they don\u2019t have the skill-set to do the work in the first place. But for some clients, it\u2019s just another opportunity to micromanage!\u00a0Trying to make artistic decisions is hard enough as it is, let alone with a chirpy client throwing in ideas from the <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/animation-90s-rockos-modern-life-eJ2m2gGiFMUwg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201cnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">backseat<\/a>! If this sounds all too familiar, then\u00a0grab the wheel and let your client out at the next\u00a0light!<\/p>\n<h2>Fickle Pickle<\/h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t get stuck with a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.urbandictionary.com\/define.php?term=fickle%20pickle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201cnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">fickle pickle<\/a>! Sometimes it\u2019s better to give a client fewer options at the end\u00a0of a freelance project so they don\u2019t get overwhelmed with\u00a0choices. There\u2019s \u2018indecisive\u2019, and then there\u2019s \u2018fickle\u2019! If you\u2019ve been going\u00a0back and forth with a client for weeks about\u00a0two slightly different shades of teal, chances are they\u2019re a pesky client!
