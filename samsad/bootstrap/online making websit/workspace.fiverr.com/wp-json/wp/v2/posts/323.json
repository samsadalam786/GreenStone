You don\u2019t have distracting co-workers on a loud call right next to you. You don\u2019t have coworkers coming into your office every five minutes through what has suddenly turned into a revolving door. Most importantly, you don\u2019t have to wear pants. But with perks also come disadvantages and a major disadvantage for every home office freelancer is loneliness. So to combat that mind-numbing loneliness, home office freelancers have some solid options to create socially fulfilling, imaginary colleagues. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Work Spouse<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In every office, there are various couplings of \u201cwork marriages\u201d that get close co-workers through the day. Work marriages inspire a sense of comradery, loyalty, love, support, and bickering that a holy matrimony brings. The first thing to do is to tell your imagined work spouse something you wouldn\u2019t tell another co-worker, something secretive or gossipy. \u00a0In no time, you\u2019ll be calling your imaginary friend either your \u201cwork wife\u201d or \u201cwork husband\u201d and the rest of the \u201coffice\u201d you\u2019re also imagining will think it\u2019s super annoying but hey, they\u2019re just jealous. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Boss<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being your own boss is hard. There\u2019s no one to blame when things aren\u2019t going right but yourself. You have to set your own deadlines, you need to both pep talk and straight talk yourself, and sometimes, you even need to ask yourself for a raise. So it\u2019s no surprise that a key imaginary colleague for home office freelancers to create is \u201cthe boss\u201d. When you want someone to blame, talk smack about your imaginary boss! Gossip, curse \u2018em out, and question their choices! It\u2019ll feel good to put some of that pressure where it really belongs\u2026on the \u201chigher-up\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Intern<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t you wish you had some help! Someone to do the mundane office work you\u2019re sick of doing like stuffing envelopes or ordering business cards. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if someone could grab you your coffee and know your order, just the way you like it. What if you had someone who was there just to learn from you? Well, there\u2019s no one to fill that role like an imaginary intern. Wax on to your imaginary intern about all the important work you\u2019re doing. Teach them the things no one wants to listen to you pontificate about. You\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re making real change in a person\u2019s life. Just remember, they are imaginary so unfortunately, you still have to grab your own coffee.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Postal Service Worker<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you get sick of talking to imaginary colleagues, try to make a colleague out of someone who stops by your door each day\u2026drum roll please\u2026your postal service worker! This won\u2019t be a simple task. You don\u2019t want to piss off the mailman enough that he ends up spitting in your mail, just like they do in the restaurant biz. This is a real life person so you have to ease in to the conversation. Ask your postal service worker about his or her life and slip in a few facts about what\u2019s going on with you. A real water cooler conversation except, inevitably, by your mailbox. Eventually, they\u2019ll become that colleague who brings you your mail just like mailroom workers in office buildings. And they won\u2019t even notice you\u2019ve made a colleague out of them. Hey, they\u2019ll probably be happy they have someone to talk to as well. Think it\u2019s hard for you? Getting mail is exciting and they get mail that\u2019s not for them and they spend their day driving it around, giving it to other people. Talk about loneliness. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When all else fails, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WILSON<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> it.<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember Tom Hanks in <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Castaway<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">? His best friend was a volleyball named Wilson. When (spoiler alert) Wilson fell off his makeshift boat and sailed into sea, Tom Hanks screamed \u201cWilson! Wilson!\u201d and audiences around America cried with a very thin, blonde-bearded Forrest Gump. If you need a physical object to get into the spirit of having an imaginary colleague, channel Tom Hanks and anthropomorphize a stapler, a notepad, or a special choccy you keep on your desk. You\u2019ll never feel alone with your very own Wilson by your side. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Chief Operator<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your CO is your spirited left hand. What M is to James Bond, your Chief Operator is to you, sans the lethal weapons&#8230;instead taking care of your invoicing, paperwork and the other admin work. This might sound like another fictitious colleague, but it actually can be reality if you <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/signup\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">become an Fiverr Workspace member<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So there you have it! A perfectly acceptable list of imaginary colleagues to create for your home office. Just remember, if you go to talk to the postal service worker or any other real life human being, put on some pants. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are perks to being a freelancer with a home office.
