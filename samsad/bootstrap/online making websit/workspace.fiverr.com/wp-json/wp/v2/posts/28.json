It\u2019s your sanctuary; it\u2019s your shelter; it\u2019s your place to dream in peace. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your home is where you live, love and most recently, where you work. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the full-time independent workforce continues to steadily increase, so too has it become just as common to refer to a certain amount of space within your house as your home office.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Traditionally, it is understood that the portion of your home used specifically and exclusively for workspace is tax deductible. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, there are many more deductions that you may very much qualify for but are not familiar with just yet. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Luckily you have stumbled upon this article, which will <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/commonly-missed-and-miscategorized-freelance-tax-deductions\/\">help you discover those less common deductions<\/a> related to your home office.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Work from home tax deductions<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ll get into explaining exactly which expenses you can deduct if you work from home. But first, let&#8217;s define some basic ground rules.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentally, if you can prove that your home office is essential to your business and you spend a substantial amount of time there, then you are on track for a tax deduction. <\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>The home office exclusive use rule for tax-deductible expenses:<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What qualifies a space as a home office? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to qualify as a home office, your home has to either be your principal place of business or it&#8217;s where you see clients, customers, or patients. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Going forward, this definition will be referred to as the <\/span><b>exclusive rule<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> as it clearly outlines that your home office space must be exclusive to your business.<\/span><br \/>\nRelated:\u00a0<em><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/commonly-missed-and-miscategorized-freelance-tax-deductions\/\">7 Commonly Missed and Miscategorized Freelance Tax Deductions<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>The exception to the exclusive rule:<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any rule, there are accompanying exceptions. And that is certainly the case here with the exclusive rule. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below is a list of instances that also allow you to claim your home office as a tax-deductible expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>1. It&#8217;s the only location of your business<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There may be a room in your home that is your TV room and also the room where you store products, goods, and frankly any items that you make and sell. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If this storage room is the only location of your business, then this room qualifies as your home office even if you also watch TV in that same space. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>2. You do your billing and other office work from there\u00a0<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You qualify for a home office deduction if you do your billing and other office work from your office but spend most of your time elsewhere due to the nature of your work. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fundamentally, if you can prove that your home office is essential to your business and you spend a substantial amount of time there, then you are on track for a tax deduction.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>3. Your employer requires you to work from home<\/h4>\n<p>As long as you don\u2019t charge your employer rent, you can also qualify for the deduction if your employer requires you to work from home.<br \/>\nIf your arrangement to work for home has been given to you out of convenience for you, then it is NOT eligible for tax deduction.<\/p>\n<h4>4. You converted a separate structure on your property into an office<\/h4>\n<p>If you\u2019ve converted a detached garage to an office or studio, then these separate structures on your property qualify for a deduction. These separate structures do not have to be a part of your main place of business to qualify.<br \/>\nMore: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/our-no-1-piece-of-advice-for-first-time-self-employed-taxpayers\/\"><em>Our Number 1 Piece of Advice for First Time Self-Employed Taxpayers<\/em><\/a><\/p>\n<h3>\u201cDirect\u201d expenses for working from home<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now within this business part of your home, you may qualify for several \u201cdirect\u201d expenses that are 100% tax deductible given, again, that they are used specifically in your office and for your office only. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s a brief list of direct expense examples:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hiring someone to paint your home office<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying a computer for your work<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Office supplies i.e. printer, file cabinets, etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The direct expenses related to your home office are clearly elements of your business that directly impact your success. <\/span><br \/>\n<b>TIP: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thoroughly document these expenses by retaining all relevant receipts and tracking your annual expenses.<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Fiverr Workspace automates <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=home-office-expenses\">keeping track of your expenses<\/a>, files them and get the reports you need for tax time. <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=home-office-expenses\">Find out more here.<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>\u201cIndirect\u201d home office expenses<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all related home office expenses are referred to as direct. As you may have guessed, the other category is indirect expenses. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out the following list for examples of these indirect expenses:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mortgage interest<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Real estate taxes<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilities (heating, cooling, lighting, water)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home repairs and maintenance (so long as they benefit both the business and personal parts of the home)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Homeowners insurance premiums<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home alarm systems<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Landscaping (if your home office is used to meet with patients, clients, and customers)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These deductions can be calculated simply by multiplying each expense by your home office percentage. If your home office is 250 sq. ft. and your home is 2,500 sq. ft., your office takes up 10% of your home. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And for example, if you spend $200 a month on electricity, and your home office takes up 10% of your home, then you would be able to expense $20\/mo for electricity as a home office expense. In total, you\u2019d deduct $240 for the tax year to account for your electricity. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that\u2019s just one of the many additional tax deductions for your home office.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>TIP: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your total freelance tax deductions for your home office cannot exceed the amount of money that you generate from your home office business. <\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>Home office depreciation calculations<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While repairs to your home are absolutely eligible for tax deduction and can be calculated just as described, renovations must be calculated according to depreciation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depreciation is based on the idea that everything wears out eventually, even a home. In order to properly find your home office depreciation, you would calculate the tax basis of your home in its entirety. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow these steps: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the cost of improvements and add them to the purchase price of your home.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then subtract the value of the land that your home is located on.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following, multiply this number by your home office percentage. This number is your tax basis for your home office.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lastly, take your newly calculated tax basis for your home office and divide it by 39. (Depreciation deductions are figured over a 39-year period for home offices.)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Know your home office tax deductions<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your home office is where you build your business and strive for success. It only makes sense that you know the rules on how the money you\u2019re investing in that space could be saved. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home office deductions &#8211; from the exceptions to the rule to the nitty-gritty of depreciation of home renovations &#8211; should now be demystified. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And if you do find yourself unsure about whether or not your home office expenses qualify as freelance tax deductions, then chat with your Chief Operator at Fiverr Workspace &#8211; they answer these questions each and every day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you work from a home office, there are plenty of expenses you can deduct from your tax bill to save money.
