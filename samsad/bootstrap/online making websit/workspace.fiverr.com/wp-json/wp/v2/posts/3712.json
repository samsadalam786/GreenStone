A direct pitch, one that&#8217;s well-informed and relevant to a prospect&#8217;s needs, is one of the more strategic approaches to getting new clients.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-ways-content-marketers-can-find-freelance-work%2F&#038;text=A%20direct%20pitch%20is%20one%20of%20the%20more%20strategic%20approaches%20to%20getting%20new%20clients.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A direct pitch is one of the more strategic approaches to getting new clients. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-ways-content-marketers-can-find-freelance-work%2F&#038;text=A%20direct%20pitch%20is%20one%20of%20the%20more%20strategic%20approaches%20to%20getting%20new%20clients.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nIf you&#8217;ve already built an online portfolio, or have optimized your LinkedIn profile, you&#8217;re already halfway there. That said, you can&#8217;t expect a single URL will land you a new client. It&#8217;s imperative to position your abilities in the context of your potential client&#8217;s\u00a0own challenges and objectives. A big piece of this rests on learning what a prospect is passionate about and finding where they are trying to move the needle for their own business. If you&#8217;re able to help them in these efforts, you&#8217;re on your way to locking in a new partner.<br \/>\n(If you&#8217;re a freelancer writer,\u00a0check out these tips from editors on what they look for in quality pitches.)<\/p>\n<h3>Use\u00a0LinkedIn to your advantage<\/h3>\n<p>We often think of LinkedIn as the go-to job searching site, but it can also act as a community for freelancers to find new gigs and offer opportunities throughout an individual\u2019s network.<br \/>\nLinkedIn\u2019s job board allows you to set your preferences for Freelance or Contract positions only. This can offer a very tailored and comprehensive tool from which freelancers\u00a0can begin their searches.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s also vital not to downplay the networking aspect of the platform. Recruiters are always posting to their network looking to fill certain roles, which is a perfect chance for you to start a one-on-one conversation and leverage that direct pitch you\u2019ve been sending through email.<br \/>\nThere\u2019s a strategy to finding freelance work as a one person show and it starts with taking a multifaceted approach. Direct pitching, leveraging LinkedIn, and searching the top\u00a0freelance job networks can help you secure a steady stream of clients.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Scoring freelance work as a content marketer involves a multifaceted approach.
