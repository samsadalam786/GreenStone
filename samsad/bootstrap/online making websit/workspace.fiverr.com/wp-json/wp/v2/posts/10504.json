There are plenty of ways to engage with&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-you-need-freelance-community\/\">freelance communities<\/a>&nbsp;and even meet up with other freelance friends in person.<br>Since the UN nominated the 30th of July the International Day of Friendship, what better time to up your freelance social circle?<br>Here are a few ways to find your freelance tribe \u2013 even if they are on the other side of the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Facebook Groups<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These days, there\u2019s a Facebook group for almost anything. Find one that suits your niche \u2013 whether it\u2019s freelance writing, development, designing, or something else. Also join one that can help with issues common to all freelancers \u2013 I find&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/freelancemasterminds\/\">Freelance Masterminds<\/a>&nbsp;super useful. Freelancers from all over share their wins and failures and get support from the community, and there are awesome resources being shared all the time.<br>Being an Aussie, I also belong to a group called&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/freelancejungle\/\">Freelance Jungle<\/a>&nbsp;which is full of local freelancers, who even host regular meetups at the end of the year. You can likely find one in your local area too.<br>I can\u2019t recommend being part of a relevant Facebook group enough \u2013 if nothing else, it\u2019ll quickly show you that the issues you are facing are not unique, and there is always someone who will offer their support, even if it is from afar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Other social media platforms<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on which platforms you\u2019re active on, you may be able to find relevant freelance friends through other social media too. Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Youtube are all places where you may wish to make connections if these platforms make sense for you.<br>Don\u2019t be afraid to comment on other people\u2019s posts if they ring true \u2013 you\u2019ll be surprised how often people will send a friendly reply and how these kinds of connections can blossom into actual friendships. And if all else fails\u2026 try the Tweet below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:100%\">\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\"><span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-to-make-freelance-friends%2F&#038;text=5%20Ways%20to%20Make%20Freelance%20Friends&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5 Ways to Make Freelance Friends <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-ways-to-make-freelance-friends%2F&#038;text=5%20Ways%20to%20Make%20Freelance%20Friends&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/pre>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Meetups<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If it\u2019s more of a face-to-face connection you\u2019re craving, get onto&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/\">https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/<\/a>. There are Meetups planned for just about anything you\u2019re interested in \u2013 including for professional networking. Find a freelancer or startup group near you and attend a couple of events. You never know \u2013 you may even meet some new clients there!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Coworking Spaces<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d definitely recommend working from a coworking space on a regular basis. While it can be a little pricey, it will pay off in the long-run for your mental health and productivity. Plus, it\u2019s a great place to meet freelance friends as well as new clients. If you prefer to only do it once in a while, you may even meet other like-minded people there who\u2019d like to work from a cafe or a library with you in the future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Classes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer it\u2019s important to constantly upskill so you keep up with changes in your industry. Taking a short course can be a great way to meet like-minded freelancers at the same time. Make sure to introduce yourself and share your contact details so you can stay in touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Make a new freelance friend<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of International Friendship Day, broaden your freelance social circle using one of these freelance communities. The support, expertise and camaraderie you\u2019ll gain will be&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/independent-together\/\">a priceless investment<\/a>&nbsp;in your continued
