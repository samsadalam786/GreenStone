A traditional full-time job where you\u2019ll clock in and clock out for eight hours a day, five days a week?<br \/>\nJust a few years ago, nearly every new grad\u2019s answer to that question would be something like, \u201cYes, duh! That\u2019s what you do after college.\u201d<br \/>\nBut, there\u2019s no denying that the workforce is changing. Freelancers now make up a whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elainepofeldt\/2016\/10\/06\/new-survey-freelance-economy-shows-rapid-growth\/#5d7570d77c3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">35 percent of the U.S. labor force<\/a>. And, even further, it\u2019s predicted that this number will skyrocket to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/michakaufman\/2014\/02\/28\/five-reasons-half-of-you-will-be-freelancers-in-2020\/#2595a7f06d39\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50 percent by the year 2020<\/a>.<br \/>\nWhat was once considered an unstable or flighty way to earn a living has now transformed into a real, bonafide career path. In fact, in most countries, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.businessnewsdaily.com\/7959-freelance-pay-rates.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelancers earn more<\/a> than average workers.<br \/>\nNeedless to say, the freelance lifestyle appeals to the younger generation for numerous reasons (aside from just the ability to work in their pajamas).<br \/>\nHowever, is pursuing full-time freelance a wise idea for recent college graduates? Or, is it better for them to get some more traditional experience under their belts before diving headfirst into the freelance life?<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelance-full-time-9-5-new-grads-consider%2F&#038;text=Consider%20these%20pros%20and%20cons%20of%20full-time%20freelancing%20as%20a%20recent%20college%20grad.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Consider these pros and cons of full-time freelancing as a recent college grad. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelance-full-time-9-5-new-grads-consider%2F&#038;text=Consider%20these%20pros%20and%20cons%20of%20full-time%20freelancing%20as%20a%20recent%20college%20grad.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nThere\u2019s nothing like a good old fashioned pros and cons list to bring some much-needed clarity. So, let\u2019s take a look at the upsides and drawbacks college grads should consider when deciding between freelancing or a full-time job after graduation.<\/p>\n<h3>The&nbsp;cons<\/h3>\n<h4>1. Small professional network<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cRecent grads typically have not had enough professional experiences to have built the needed network,\u201d explains Sharri Harmel, Career Coach at <a href=\"https:\/\/sharriharmel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SH Career Coaching and Consulting<\/a>.<br \/>\nFinding clients is one of the toughest parts of getting a freelance career off the ground. And, that becomes even more challenging if you\u2019ve spent the majority of your life in a classroom\u2014rather than out in the business world shaking hands and making connections.\u201d<br \/>\n\u201cThink about it: If you haven\u2019t built up your skills and don\u2019t have any contacts, that\u2019s a hard place to start as a freelancer,\u201d explains <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lilyherman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lily Herman<\/a>, a freelance writer for Teen Vogue, Allure, Glamour, Refinery29, and more, who worked a full-time job for nine months out of college, before moving to full-time freelancing\u2014which she had done a lot of while pursuing her education.<br \/>\n\u201cOn the flip side, getting your start somewhere stable full-time allows you to build up both those skills and contacts while also trying something on the side,\u201d she adds.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Income instability<\/h4>\n<p>Finances are one of those real-world things that\u2014while not necessarily fun to think about\u2014are important for recent grads to consider. When the average class of 2016 graduate collects their degree right along with <a href=\"https:\/\/studentloanhero.com\/student-loan-debt-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$37,172 in student loan debt<\/a>, thinking about money is a must.<br \/>\n\u201cThe lack of a consistent income can be very hard, especially when a young professional has not been able to create a savings cushion,\u201d shares Harmel.<br \/>\nAside from paychecks, Harmel lists numerous other reasons recent graduates might want to be wary of freelancing right out of the gate. From individual healthcare costs to the lack of employer matching for a retirement savings account, a more traditional full-time role comes with some pretty big financial perks that are worth considering.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Lack of&nbsp;self-awareness<\/h4>\n<p>While new grads might feel like they\u2019re on top of the world, they still have a great deal to learn about their own unique skills and strengths.<br \/>\n\u201cRecent grads need time to get to know themselves better,\u201d Harmel says, \u201cWhat they like, what they value, what provides meaning to their lives, what unique strengths they have. All of that self-knowledge takes some time to develop and contributes to a person\u2019s decision whether or not to freelance and what service or skill they are offering to potential clients.\u201d<br \/>\nIt was this very thing that inspired Herman to accept a full-time job after graduation, despite the fact that she already had a successful and profitable freelance side hustle while in college.<br \/>\n\u201cI knew I could do okay living the freelancer life, but you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re best suited for until you try other options and take other opportunities,\u201d she says, \u201cBecause I took that role, I now have zero \u2018what ifs.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The pros<\/h3>\n<h4>1. Schedule flexibility<\/h4>\n<p>\u201cI think more college grads than ever are considering freelance as an option to augment their income while doing something they enjoy,\u201d shares Career Coach, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kbcareercoach.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kim Bilawchuk<\/a>, \u201cThey have flexibility with their schedules.\u201d<br \/>\nThis is one of the biggest draws of freelancing. When a reported <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.accessperks.com\/millennial-employee-engagement-loyalty-statistics-the-ultimate-collection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">74 percent of Millennials<\/a> want flexible work schedules (and 43 percent would switch jobs for greater flexibility!), freelancing can seem like a dream come true for recent grads who are dreading the eight hours per day, five days per week grind. In Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/slash-workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slash Workers report<\/a>, flexibility was the No. 2 reason why people chose to go freelance (27 percent of respondents), behind personal growth.<\/p>\n<h4>2. Control&nbsp;over professional development<\/h4>\n<p>Another thing most recent grads crave? Control over their own career trajectory:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/businessjournal\/191435\/millennials-work-life.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">87 percent of millennials<\/a> state that professional development or career growth opportunities are very important to them.<br \/>\n\u201cIf the company isn\u2019t giving them those opportunities to grow as professionals, they\u2019ll start looking for another job,\u201d explains Harmel, \u201cCompared to Boomers and even some GenX-ers, that is why millennials can look more like gig workers than long-term company-loyal employees.\u201d<br \/>\nBut, as a freelancer, you have the autonomy and flexibility to find and accept projects that interest you and push you in the direction you most want to go.<\/p>\n<h3>Full-time job + part-time freelancing = best of both worlds?<\/h3>\n<p>Just looking at those lists, it seems like freelancing straight out of college isn\u2019t necessarily the way to go. Even Herman herself, who is now only a year out of school with a booming full-time freelance career, warns recent grads to be somewhat wary.<br \/>\n\u201cI would only really recommend new grads go after full-time freelancing if they\u2019ve done it before, they\u2019re pros at their craft, and\/or if that\u2019s standard for the industry,\u201d she says.<br \/>\nDoes that mean new graduates need to drop the freelance dream altogether? Absolutely not. Instead, it just might be better to start off with a side hustle, before putting all of their eggs into the freelance basket.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelance-full-time-9-5-new-grads-consider%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20or%20Full-Time%209%20to%205%3A%20What%20New%20Grads%20Should%20Consider&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelance or Full-Time 9 to 5: What New Grads Should Consider <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Ffreelance-full-time-9-5-new-grads-consider%2F&#038;text=Freelance%20or%20Full-Time%209%20to%205%3A%20What%20New%20Grads%20Should%20Consider&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\n\u201cIf you\u2019re able to take on some part-time freelancing on top of a full-time job, I say go for it!\u201d Herman adds. However, she also recommends that full-time employees check with their employers before accepting any freelance gigs, to ensure they don\u2019t get themselves into any hot water legally.<br \/>\n\u201cI think freelancing could be a great way to gain some relevant experience while looking for something more permanent, or could offer the flexibility to take a lower-paying role and still be able to live on their own,\u201d confirms Bilawchuk, \u201cI think the more experiences people have, the more marketable they are.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Finding your path<\/h3>\n<p>With all of that said, Herman doesn\u2019t believe that her recent grad status has impacted the success of her freelance career\u2014a point that\u2019s backed up by her numerous impressive bylines.<br \/>\n\u201cBecause I\u2019d been freelancing for so long in college, most people weren\u2019t even aware that I was a college student, and they aren\u2019t aware that I\u2019m a year out of school now,\u201d she says, \u201cIt also doesn\u2019t affect my confidence at all; I know I\u2019ve been doing this for a while, and that makes all the difference.\u201d<br \/>\nIn regards to the great freelance debate for new grads, there really isn\u2019t one black and white answer. It\u2019s really all about analyzing your own situation and forging your own path.<br \/>\n\u201cMore than anything, freelancing comes down to practice and time spent working on your craft,\u201d Herman concludes, \u201cIn my case, the more I wrote and took on clients, the more mistakes I made and lessons I got to learn early on. That just comes with practice, not age. At this point, my work (and my own hustle) speaks for itself.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Should new grads pursue full-time freelancing?
