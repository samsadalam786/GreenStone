Or, as author Marty Neumeier puts it in his <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brand Gap<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: <\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">\u201c[Your brand] is not what you say it is. It\u2019s what they say it is.\u201d <\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In other words, a brand is not a logo, a couple of canonical fonts and colors, and the latest tagline. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It\u2019s an identity. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And as anyone who\u2019s studied a little postmodernism or psychology knows, identity is a social construct. It\u2019s an amalgam of <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">what you say<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> your brand is and what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">other people feel<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about your brand.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So if you already established a personal and\/or freelance brand and want to take it a few steps further, you\u2019ve got to focus on how people perceive you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">now<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. To find out how people perceive you now, just ask. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">How you ask that question will look a little different depending on what work you\u2019ve already done, but it all boils down to finding out what people think about the \u201cyou\u201d you\u2019ve worked so hard to define on the web. You might sit down with people who know your work and ask them what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">they<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> think you\u2019re passionate about, what you\u2019re good at, and where your expertise lies. Or you might send a survey out to your newsletter list and ask for their thoughts on what you publish now, and what they want to see more of.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">However you gather this intel on your personal brand, the important thing is the next step, when you ask yourself:<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><em>Is this the brand I want to be?<\/em> <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If your answer\u2019s a resounding \u201cyes,\u201d you\u2019re in a very good place. Don\u2019t get me wrong: it\u2019ll take some work to build your freelance brand and extend your influence further. But most of that work will be about doubling-down on what you\u2019re already doing. More on that in a moment. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If your answer to the question \u201cis this the brand I want\u201d is a \u201cnot so much,\u201d the job\u2019s a bit different, and I\u2019ll dive into that toward the end of this article.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But first, let\u2019s see what you need to focus on if your personal brand looks good, but you want to go a step further.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How to extend a personal brand you already love<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you dig what people think and say about you already \u2014 or if it at least accurately captures what you\u2019re <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">trying<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> to do with your personal brand, congrats! Your next steps are all about doing what you already do, but doing more of it, better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Take a look at your personal website and social properties<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">First step is to take a look at the core of your personal brand: those online spaces where you built the foundation of your personal brand. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Review the work you\u2019ve shared, the blogs you\u2019ve posted, and the tweets you fire out to the world. Take a look at the little snippets of text you use to brand yourself on these profiles, and always ask yourself: <\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><b>Am I doing the best possible job of representing my brand?<\/b><\/b><\/li>\n<li><b>Does this particular profile align with or connect to my other profiles?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I.e., do your Twitter and LinkedIn profiles look and feel they represent the same person, or are they totally divergent? <\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Is what I\u2019m doing in this space valuable?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> I.e., is the time you\u2019re investing on this network or website yielding tangible results for your personal brand?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you don\u2019t feel like your self-descriptions represent your brand, edit them. And think carefully about the value of consistency or divergence across your profiles. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Ensuring that they\u2019re consistent from network to network will ensure everyone\u2019s getting the same experience of you \u2014 but it can certainly be valuable to spice things up from network to network. For instance, you might use the same headshot on both LinkedIn and Twitter, but you might <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">not<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> post your expletive-filled tirade against Trump on LinkedIn.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Or maybe you totally do. Maybe <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">that\u2019s<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> your brand. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The idea here is that there\u2019s no one rule that applies equally to all of us. The important thing is to think carefully about how your present yourself online, and make sure everything you do on each work is <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">intentional<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, and not just the result of a 3 a.m., wine-fueled tweetstorm. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Build (more) relationships<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since a brand is a social construct \u2014 i.e., more about what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">they<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> think than what <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">you<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> say \u2014 socializing is an incredibly powerful tool for building your brand and influence as a freelancer. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So, try to engage more. If you\u2019ve mostly been broadcasting whatever content you create (be it articles or designs or sound bytes), then try jumping into conversations on topics you care about <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">without<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> sharing some external URL. Or if the reverse is true, try broadcasting more of your content. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Also, dig deeper into your social worlds. Most social networks go quite deep, with all kinds of little niche groups springing up across their scattered URLs. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So spend a day searching through Facebook and LinkedIn for groups focused on topics you care about. Devote some time to trawling Twitter for others who speak on the same topics and industries you do, follow them, and explore their work. Ditto for Google+, if you\u2019re on there. And look out for some <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.slacklist.info\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Slack teams you might join<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The key here, as is always true with social networks, is to be human, and be genuine. Don\u2019t contribute <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">just<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> because you want to extend your freelance brand. Contribute because you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">care<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about the topic and the community. If the groups you join truly reflect the same concerns as your personal brand, it shouldn\u2019t be hard. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The best part about these communities, when it comes to sharing your own content, is that they\u2019ll become the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">perfect<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> sounding boards for your work. They\u2019ll often provide feedback on in-progress creations, and help spread the word for fleshed-out stuff. Super powerful.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Double down on your core topics<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Take a look at the stuff you create and share with the world, and think carefully about how you can do more with that. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019ve built a reputation as a commentator on interaction design, consider how you might deepen that reputation. If you wrote a listicle about the qualities of great interactions, maybe take a deep dive into each quality, and turn it into a series. Or better yet, a whole ebook! Or build a website that curates and comments on super interaction designs on the web, like a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.useronboard.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">UserOnboard<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> for interactions. Or create an email course to help others learn what makes for an awesome interaction. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You might even start putting a price tag on your expertise. Maybe charge for that ebook, instead of putting it out there for free? <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Aim higher with your publications<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019ve been building your brand for a while, chances are that you already publish a ton of stuff, most of it for free. Whether it\u2019s articles on Medium, Dribbble shots, Instagrams, or long-winded rants on Facebook, you publish. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But as you\u2019ve probably learned, getting any attention for all that publishing you do can be tough. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So let others do the work for you, and maybe get paid for it too. Find Medium Publications that might want your work and submit to them. Pitch esteemed industry publications like Smashing Magazine, UX Booth, and A List Apart. Put together some talk outlines and see if you can\u2019t get HOW, Typo, or Generate to bite.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>\u201cWork\u201d for free<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You know how you know you\u2019ve made it? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">When other professionals in your space <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">want your opinion<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. When they\u2019re not asking for your feedback because you\u2019re just part of the process, but because they value your opinions and experience and feel like their work will be that much better with your input. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So embrace those moments when Joe from your last gig wants you to review his latest landing page. Offer to help people in one of those communities you recently joined (see \u201cBuild (more) relationships\u201d above) write or edit their next blog post or conference talk pitch. Be the guy or gal who actually <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">does<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> provide extensive, thoughtful feedback on that portfolio shared to Designer News or Reddit. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">And this doesn\u2019t stop at providing feedback on others\u2019 work. You can even take on creative work for nonprofits or community efforts. Or it could mean building out that simple app you\u2019ve always wanted but never saw making any money \u2014 but doing it as an open source or community project. Just think of it as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/817958\/no-free-work-is-the-wrong-advice-for-creative-people-career-advice-from-graphic-design-legend-paula-scher\/?ref=webdesignernews.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">working for influence, instead of money<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Not only will those you help appreciate it, you\u2019ll start to build a reputation for being genuinely helpful within your community. Plus, you\u2019ll literally have the chance to embed your own ideas and viewpoints within others\u2019 work \u2014 and if that\u2019s not influence at work, I don\u2019t know what is.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Consider a little investment<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Brace yourself: this might sound a little crazy. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But as someone who\u2019s worked in content marketing for several years now, I can definitely attest to the efficacy of this method, at least when it comes to sharing content. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The big problem is that it <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">might<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> feel a little bit \u2026 icky. Because if you\u2019re like many people (including me), advertising\u2019s brand is about as high-quality as Fox News\u2019. It just feels like pandering. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But here\u2019s the thing: if your content is high-quality, you\u2019re not pandering. You\u2019re just buying visibility. And in a world so crowded with content publishers are desperate for you to just <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">see<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, let alone share, that\u2019s pretty valuable. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">So consider setting aside a little money to promote your very best, most valuable work. Such as that premium ebook or email course you built out (see \u201cDouble down on your core topics\u201d). It could pay off in spades. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">But investing in your brand doesn\u2019t just have to be focused on content promotion. You might also consider hiring that amazing developer you know to revamp your website, or even create a custom logo just for you. Or engage a copywriter you know to rewrite your site copy with your input. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Everything worth doing is worth spending a little money on, at one point or another. And if your personal brand is a key element of how you make money, it\u2019s worth all the more. As they say, you gotta spend money to make money! <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Ok, so what if I don\u2019t love where my personal brand\u2019s at?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you aren\u2019t <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">loving<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> what you\u2019re hearing about your personal brand, it\u2019s time for your own personal pivot. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Exciting, right!?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All snark aside, rebranding yourself actually can be a fun and rewarding exercise. And the first step is the same as what I outlined above in the \u201cTake a look at your personal website and social properties\u201d section. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Audit your personal website and social properties, but this time, take a careful look at what might be contributing to the off-brand brand you\u2019re detecting amongst your audience. It might be a few misleading words in your description. Or maybe that series of tweets that, in retrospect, <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">could<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> be read as an endorsement of Vladimir Putin. Or it could be those somewhat dated portfolio pieces from that time you worked at a car insurance company.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Okay, so that last example is actually from my personal experience. And it provides a nice example to ground this discussion. Over the last several years, I\u2019ve had several inquiries from progressive insurance companies and other fintech-type brands. And I\u2019ve had quite a few letters of interest from people looking for creative marketing\/advertising copywriters. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">These days, I don\u2019t think of myself as either of things. So those people are barking up the wrong tree, but it\u2019s totally my fault! Because I still list my creative copywriting work for a financial\/tech brand on my personal website. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because the reality is: you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">do<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> have power over your personal brand. Ultimately, your brand is shaped by others\u2019 perceptions of you, but you can modify those perceptions via what you present to others. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You have power over your personal brand to the extent that you control how you present yourself, and the content you share with the world. By carefully controlling what you present to the world \u2014 even if it means removing good work from your portfolio \u2014 you can take a strong step toward rebranding yourself. And that means higher-quality leads towards your next big gig. <\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<em>Be sure to read more from <a href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">John and Webflow on their blog<\/a> where you&#8217;ll find great info on freelance, design, and many other great topics.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>News flash: You don\u2019t control your brand.
