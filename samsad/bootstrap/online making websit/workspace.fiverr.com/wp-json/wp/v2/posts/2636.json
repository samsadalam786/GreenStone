I pictured myself stepping out cautiously toward the threshold of the airplane door: that thin line between humdrum half-fulfillment and perilous freedom. I imagine my anxiety blending into exuberance as I make my descent.<br \/>\nThe plunge into freelancing has a similar feeling: one of excitement, panic and wonder (though I\u2019m sure jumping out a plane is a touch more intense\u2014it\u2019s the analogy that counts). Before the pilot takes off, the skydiver makes his leap, or the hustler begins their <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/how-to-freelance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">journey into self-employment<\/a>, each of them have questions that they must address.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re building up a business and\u00a0gearing up to go it alone, ask yourself the following questions to see if you\u2019re <em>really<\/em> ready.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;Can I handle the risk?&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Some people love the stability of working their nine to five, and that\u2019s an important characteristic to consider about yourself. Freelancing has to be more than a fantasy; it has to be a genuine career goal. Persistence and passion will play a huge role in determining your potential for success.<br \/>\nWhile research suggests <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/neilpatel\/2015\/01\/16\/90-of-startups-will-fail-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-10\/#12a8337255e1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nine out of 10 startups fail<\/a>, it\u2019s important to remember that you have the power to improve the odds of your business succeeding. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re merely rolling the dice and praying for a seven or 11 on the Come Out. Your work ethic plays an important role in whether your startup will be profitable.<br \/>\nImportant characteristics of a successful self-employed worker\u00a0include, but are not limited to being punctual, demonstrating high energy levels, having an optimistic outlook, and maintaining an eagerness to learn.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;Is the timing right?&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Timing plays a huge part in the success of a startup. Ask yourself:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I have any money saved right now? Make sure you have a little dough stowed away for potential\u00a0lapses between projects. <a href=\"https:\/\/investor.vanguard.com\/emergency-fund\/amount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vanguard suggests<\/a> socking away three to six months in living expenses.<\/li>\n<li>Do you have a current network?\u00a0You should have a few prospective clients in the wings before you decide to fly. (Need help getting started? Here are some tips for sending the perfect cold-email.)<\/li>\n<li>What do I, or does my family, need at the moment? If you\u2019re single, then your list of necessities is likely a bit shorter. If you\u2019re the breadwinner with a family at home (who may or may not be contemplating giving up benefits), then you&#8217;ll have more to consider.<\/li>\n<li>How much money do you need to keep your family afloat? Well, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnpp.usda.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/crc2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report from the USDA<\/a> found that the average cost to raise a child from birth to 17 was $233,610.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>&#8220;Is one job suffering because of another?&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve already taken the plunge while maintaining full-time employment (AKA side-hustling), there will undoubtedly come a time when you have to ask yourself: \u201cIs my work suffering at one job because of the other?\u201d If the answer is yes, this could potentially be great news.<br \/>\nWhen it becomes impossible to make deadlines while keeping your full-time job, then that is usually an indicator that it\u2019s time to let something go. Ideally, at this point, your freelance business is outweighing your nine to five work, meaning you have enough gigs to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/how-to-freelance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">becoming self-employed full-time<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Making the Decision<\/h3>\n<p>Take some time to decide whether or not you\u2019re truly ready to let go of your full-time employment. Are you possibly just getting overly excited about a new contract? Is it really necessary to say &#8220;sayonara?&#8221;<br \/>\nRemember, if you\u2019re going to live off freelancing, you need a lot of projects and\/or steady clients. Moreover, you\u2019re going to have to manage your time between projects and business responsibilities like bookkeeping, communications, meetings, social media upkeep, etc. You can expect\u00a0about <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/laurashin\/2014\/10\/27\/freelancers-heres-how-to-set-your-rates\/2\/#2b9660cd288c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">30 percent of your time<\/a>\u00a0to go to non-paying obligations.<br \/>\nAs for salary, there\u00a0is no exact amount that freelancers <em>should<\/em> make, but consider all of your expenses, your goals, incidentals, and taxes when determining\u00a0your rates. To make invoicing, time sheets, and banking a little easier, find yourself <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an app or website<\/a> that will do some of the work for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Deciding to work for yourself could be the best decision you&#8217;ll ever make.
