They&#8217;re a little rectangle, printed on flimsy paper, with bare bones information on it, and they all look alike. They can sometimes get the job done, sure, but they don&#8217;t stand out\u2014and as a freelancer, you need to stand out. There&#8217;s plenty of people who would love to land that same client you&#8217;re looking to land. You want their business cards to end up in the trash, and yours to end up in a prospective client&#8217;s pocket.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.moo.com\/us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MOO is one way to stand out<\/a>. Their business cards can be designed right through their website, or you can upload your own design\u2014but, most importantly, they give you a ton of options so that you end up with a card that is worth taking an extra look at. You can choose a card with rounded edges, one that includes awesome, crystal-clear imagery, or one that is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moo.com\/us\/products\/luxe\/business-cards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extra thick and features striking colors<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe pricing options for MOO cards vary greatly depending on size, quality, and design, and they are slightly more expensive than the cheap business cards you can get elsewhere\u2014but not prohibitively so. Depending on what type of sale price they are offering, you can get 50 cards for around $20, or 400 cards for anywhere from $85 to $250 depending on quality. Forking over a few hundred bucks for business cards might seem like a lot, but if that entire stack of 400 cards lands you one solid client\u2014the type of client you can make hundreds or thousands of dollars from every month\u2014then it&#8217;s well worth it.<br \/>\nMany freelancers go into business because they are great writers, or web designers, or developers\u2014but they aren&#8217;t necessarily the best business people. Some people have a knack for landing clients, for making connections, for selling themselves\u2014others do not. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/am-i-right\/201302\/the-power-first-impressions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">According to author and professor Dr. Arthur Dobrin<\/a>, \u201cfirst impressions matter but substance has the final word.\u201d The fact is, a freelancer will never have the chance to show her skills off and wow her clients if they never call or email her with a job they need done in the first place. Making a great first impression, whether it&#8217;s with wardrobe, or, yes, with business cards, might lead to some extra work in your inbox\u2014work that will allow you to develop more valuable relationships with clients, and to build your portfolio.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.moo.com\/us\/products\/postcards.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MOO offers more than just business cards<\/a>, too\u2014if you&#8217;re hosting an event and need stand-out fliers or invitations, or, after the event, if you want to send some memorable thank you cards, MOO has plenty of options for you.<br \/>\nWith each passing year, we live in a world that is <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2013\/05\/29\/mary-meeker-internet-trends-2013\/#yREvRSn05kqc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more and more inundated with images<\/a>, with information\u2014your job as a freelancer has to be to find a way to cut through all the noise and be heard. That way you are top-of-mind when someone needs your services\u2014or, when they&#8217;re thumbing through a stack of cards, yours jumps out at them, and maybe they appreciate that you worked just a bit harder than your competition to stand out.<br \/>\n<em>Fiverr Workspace members receive a discount when ordering from MOO, just <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/freelance-benefits\/Professional\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">click here<\/a> to receive a discount code.<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most business cards are boring.
