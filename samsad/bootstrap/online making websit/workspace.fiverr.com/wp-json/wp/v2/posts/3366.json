She also provided some tips on how to navigate tough personalities and situations.<br \/>\nThis sort of knowledge can be be especially helpful for temporary workers or remote workers because they\u2019re often left to operate without the same context of their surroundings that those in the office more consistently have.<\/p>\n<h3>Recognize the rift between rational thinking and emotional thinking.<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cPeople make decisions rationally, but evaluate those decisions emotionally,\u201d says Borysenko. In other words, we think differently when we\u2019re making decisions and when we\u2019re evaluating the results of those decisions. We\u2019re far less rational as humans, as workers, and as colleagues than we believe ourselves to be. Remember this the next time you find yourself bristling at a decision someone else made, find yourself passionately defending one you might have made, or sense that conflict may be on the way.<\/p>\n<p>Bridge this gap by spending time trying to get to know the people you\u2019ll be working with\u2014not just their roles, but who they are as people and how that affects their work. Temporary workers: This will endear you to coworkers who might otherwise expect you to be detached. Remote workers: This will create a sense of camaraderie that may otherwise be missing when you see these folks infrequently.<\/p>\n<h3>Seek first to understand.<\/h3>\n<p>Building on the relationships you\u2019re seeking to create with coworkers, try to get an understanding of what might inform their work style and approaches to decision making. Borysenko swears by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thediscpersonalitytest.com\/?view=Assessments_disc&amp;gclid=CP2au_vv5dICFYOKswod4psJ1w\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DISC Profile<\/a> test. Learning how others work helps provide further insight into why someone\u2019s emails may seem to have a tone, or why someone else seems to need recognition for their work. We draw quick conclusions for why we think these behaviors may take place, but that doesn\u2019t make us right. Taking the time to learn the true reasons behind these actions can change the way we collaborate with the people around us.<br \/>\nIf your organization doesn\u2019t subscribe to the \u201cpersonality profile\u201d model of getting this information, it may be incumbent upon you as a nontraditional staff member to set time to chat further with people. Show them you want to learn more about them. Give yourself enough information to confound some of those quick assumptions you might have made without that knowledge.<\/p>\n<h3>Treat people the way they want to be treated.<\/h3>\n<p>Now, here\u2019s the most essential part: Armed with that information, use it. We\u2019ve often been fed the adage, \u201ctreat people as you would like to be treated.\u201d But not everyone wants what you want, works as you work, is motivated as you\u2019re motivated. Honor what people need when you work with them, and watch them flourish.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it: Remote workers have an element of flexibility to their roles that means some traditions of work may not apply. You\u2019d want people to honor your needs in your adapted role; what does that same courtesy look like when extended to your coworkers in the office? Similarly, some standards for the office apply differently to temporary workers than they do to full-time staff. Each side should honor the needs and sensible expectations for the other.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-navigate-office-politics-when-youre-not-full-time%2F&#038;text=Want%20to%20avoid%20politics%20at%20work%3F%20Treat%20people%20how%20THEY%20want%20to%20be%20treated.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Want to avoid politics at work?

We all do what we can to exist harmoniously in our work environments, achieve the objectives set forth, and fight for the needs of our target audience. But there are times when navigating politics and getting to know people can only go so far. Some situations get to a point where they\u2019re simply too far gone. Learning to navigate office politics should by no means be seen as an excuse for staying in a toxic, abusive, or otherwise untenable office environment.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve tried to make things work with a coworker and nothing can be done to better the situation, let someone know. Don\u2019t let your \u201catypical\u201d work arrangement keep you from using your voice. Similarly, if you\u2019re finding that your time at an organization is being diminished for these difficulties, get yourself out and search for a more fulfilling and rewarding arrangement. Life is too short and you shouldn\u2019t be miserable where you work.<\/p>\n<p>As Borysenko said in the opening of her session, office politics don\u2019t always have to be bad. They can be a helpful, engaging way to participate in your workplace in a meaningful way. And despite tradition, this can be true no matter how you participate in the workplace\u2014in-house freelancers, remote, or temp.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Navigating
