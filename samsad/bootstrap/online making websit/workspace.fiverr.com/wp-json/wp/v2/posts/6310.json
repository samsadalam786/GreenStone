Know when to say no<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As freelancer, we all know the hustle that goes into hunting down new projects. It\u2019s part of the rush and the unpredictability we all love and cherish. However, that\u2019s why it can be so hard to identify when it\u2019s time to <a href=\"https:\/\/lifehacker.com\/5812134\/when-freelancers-should-turn-down-projects\">say no to a project<\/a>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reasons we should consider saying no from time to time include having too much in our queue already, identifying that the buyer might be a complicated and difficult person to work with, or understanding that it might be out of our area of expertise. Agreeing to projects that we really can\u2019t take on will deter buyers from using us again. They can tell if we weren\u2019t able to put in the work it required, or if we simply did not come with the knowledge that was required to do an excellent job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More:<\/em> <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/using-time-tracker-game-changer-freelancers\/\">Why Using a Time Tracker is a Game Changer for Freelancers<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Research the competition frequently<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I earned<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2018\/06\/28\/how-to-make-six-figures-on-fiverr.html\"> $150,000 in 6-months<\/a> this past year as a freelance writer, and I attribute my edge to my obsession with researching the competition. The world of freelancing is ever-changing and fiercely competitive, so you can&#8217;t get complacent. That\u2019s why I study gig titles, descriptions, and so forth of the other people selling exactly what I&#8217;m selling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From my observations, I use a little bit of inspiration from each and every seller, as well as an average of their pricing, to arrive at a formula that places me competitively in the center of every service I offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. The psychology of pricing<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing can be an incredibly confusing, awkward, and unnatural element of the freelancing process. Many freelancers question their set pricing, asking themselves if they should charge less or more. How can you know where that sweet spot exists?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The psychology of pricing places emphasis on charging more for your services. Why? It communicates to buyers that you are of high quality and worth a higher rate than the competitors. Now, I&#8217;m not saying you should charge a rate that is incomparably higher than the rest of the entire industry. You have to be somewhat reasonable. But, setting \u201ccheap\u201d rates will immediately tell buyers that your product is a cheaper product.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to mention, take some to sit down and analyze how much time goes into each order. Remember: each freelancing project is more than just the project itself. How much time did you spend answering questions, pitching clients, and engaging in customer service? How about revisions once the order was completed? Consider this aggregate value when identifying where you want to set your pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read more: <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\/\">How to Use a Time Tracker to Manage Your Time and Productivity<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4.  Organize your time blocks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, although this point doesn\u2019t sound as fun or exciting, you really need to sit down and analyze your time blocks. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How much time is allocated to answering messages, talking to clients, actually completing the projects, and revising the projects each day? My day generally includes one to two hours of customer service support, five to six hours of actual project completion, and 30-minutes to one hour of revisions. This breakdown is what has provided me with the right formula to draw buyers in, while also guaranteeing top quality commitment to each project I complete and edit on a daily basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, one size fits all time blocks won\u2019t work for every freelancer. Each industry is different. But, if in doubt, it\u2019s safe to assume this generic time block structure is one that will position you for success moving forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/alexandra-fasulo?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=alex\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"447\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-06-at-6.15.10-pm-1024x447.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9877\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-06-at-6.15.10-pm-1024x447.png 1024w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-06-at-6.15.10-pm-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-06-at-6.15.10-pm-768x336.png 768w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Screen-Shot-2019-02-06-at-6.15.10-pm.png 1396w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Easy Fiverr time management tips<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn\u2019t include additional common sense tips that I&#8217;ve discovered through my work on Fiverr:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Avoid procrastination at all costs:<\/strong> with the instant book feature on Fiverr, six new projects could appear while you are sleeping<\/li><li><strong>Never sell yourself short: <\/strong>you can do more than you think you can do<\/li><li><strong>Start small:<\/strong> if you feel overwhelmed by the day ahead of you, start small and work through each task piece by piece<\/li><li><strong>Get enough sleep:<\/strong> our focus and energy is directly related to the health and restfulness of our bodies<\/li><li><strong>Step away from the social media:<\/strong> power down the distractions while you are in the zone<\/li><li><strong>Buyer requests:<\/strong> if you feel like the orders aren\u2019t flowing, there is a feature within the Fiverr platform that lets you apply for jobs directly<\/li><li><strong>Marketing: <\/strong>you can also take your Fiverr gigs to the web and let other people know about the services you are now offering<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Related<\/em>: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-time-tracking-can-make-you-a-more-productive-freelancer\/\">5 Ways Time Tracking Can Make You a More Productive Freelancer<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Get excited<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s an incredibly exciting time to be a freelancer.
