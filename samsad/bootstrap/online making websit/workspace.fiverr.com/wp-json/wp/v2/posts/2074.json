And, that could take you a few different places\u2014from drafting copy for website pages to writing articles for glossy print publications to authoring blog posts to boost a company\u2019s content marketing strategy. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, writing jobs don\u2019t just end with those more traditional assignments. In fact, there are plenty more out-of-the-box sorts of jobs and projects that would appeal to those creative freelance writers who are looking to try something new and different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Need proof? Check out these five different types of unique freelance writing jobs that you might not have thought of previously, and prepare to expand your portfolio, your client base, and your skillset. Bye bye, blog posts. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Speechwriting for Silicon Valley Tycoons<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2099\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Speechwriting-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we all know, speechwriting has been big business in the political realm for ages. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, take a minute to picture the great Steve Jobs touting Apple\u2019s latest release or any other tech giant giving an inspiring Ted Talk to a crowd of wide-eyed admirers, and you\u2019ll quickly realize that speechwriting has extended far past the political stage and into the tech industry as well. <\/span><br \/>\nMore often than not, these tech gurus don\u2019t come up with those moving words totally on their own. And, here\u2019s where freelance speechwriters come into play.<br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As writer Leslie Nguyen-Oku says of the expanding profession in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ozy.com\/fast-forward\/the-next-hot-job-in-silicon-valley-is-speechwriting\/72508\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her piece written for Ozy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of poetically singing the praises of politicians, these wordsmiths are tasked with delivering messages that are slightly different: articulating the Valley\u2019s wonky mission statements to the layperson, putting out public relations fires when marquee products go haywire (here\u2019s looking at you, Samsung) and, of course, avoiding Melania Trump <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RcbiGsDMmCM\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">moments<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you\u2019ve previously heard the term \u201cspeechwriting\u201d and thought only of political jargon and stuffy three-piece suits, it\u2019s time to think again. This could be your next great opportunity. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Land the Gig:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> These major influencers don\u2019t just want to hire speechwriters\u2014they want to hire <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">excellent<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> speechwriters. The best way to do that is through research. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Speechwriting can be quite different from any project you\u2019ve tackled previously. So, you need to listen to, read, and analyze as many speeches as humanly possible. When you feel like you have your feet under you, search your favorite job boards for keywords like \u201cfreelance speechwriter\u201d and apply for the opportunities that interest you most. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Conversational Writing for Artificial Intelligence<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2098\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/chatbots-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1079\" height=\"719\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You\u2019re visiting a new website when suddenly a chat box opens up in the lower righthand corner with a friendly note asking if you need any help. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, those messages are automated. But, who do you think writes those lines to start with? That\u2019s right\u2014professional writers.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believe it or not, more and more companies are actually hiring poets and playwrights to draft those automated responses, in an effort to give those charming chatbots a little more emotion and humanity. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a piece <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/qz.com\/784239\/technology-companies-are-hiring-playwrights-and-poets-to-create-meaningful-ai\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">written by Olivia Goldhill for Quartz<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Jonathan Foster\u2014who manages the editorial team that voices Cortana, Microsoft\u2019s friendly chatbot\u2014says this, \u201cThe nuance of what a writer can do sometimes looks a lot easier than it actually is. Conversation seems simple because we do it every day but when you have to write it in a logical way that doesn\u2019t feel broken, it takes a new kind of expertise that\u2019s just burgeoning.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because of that, Quartz reports that Foster\u2019s team consists of everything from playwrights and poets to novelists and an author of children\u2019s books.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, Microsoft isn\u2019t alone. Apple is one of many other tech companies who has <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/apple\/2013\/01\/18\/more-than-human-why-does-apple-need-writers-for-siri\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">put out a call for writers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to give their artificial intelligence more of a personal touch. Needless to say, it\u2019s a unique skill\u2014and, if you have it, you\u2019re bound for a less-than-traditional writing career.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Land the Gig:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be forewarned, these jobs are typically few and far between. If you\u2019re up for cold-calling, get in touch with a few of your favorite tech companies who utilize chatbots to see if they\u2019re hiring. Otherwise, keep your eyes peeled on your favorite tech publications (or set a Google alert!) to be in the know when these sorts of gigs become available.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/a-complete-guide-to-becoming-a-freelancer\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5679\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/becoming-a-freelancer-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"201\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3.

Well, in most cases, it isn\u2019t realtors\u2014it\u2019s professional writers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a seemingly endless assortment of properties available to buy or rent, and they all need detailed and appealing descriptions written to get potential tenants and buyers through the door.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This business is so lucrative, in fact, that many writers make their livings solely in this niche\u2014writing both property descriptions and schmoozy biographies for realtors. As reported in a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2009\/05\/24\/realestate\/24cov.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">piece for the New York Times<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> written by Eric Konigsberg, Valerie Haboush is a New Jersey writer who focuses almost exclusively on real estate writing. And, she does well with it too\u2014earning anywhere from $150 to $250 per job, with which she can typically complete one per hour. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not a bad way to make a living, right?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Land the Gig:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any writer who specializes in real estate will assert that it requires a special skillset\u2014one you\u2019ll want to refine before pitching yourself to any prospective clients. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Begin to forge relationships with real estate agents in your area to find out more about the business. And, as writer Elizabeth Elstien says in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancewriting.com\/business-writing\/freelance-real-estate-writing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">her blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it\u2019s also a good idea to join <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/activerain.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ActiveRain<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014a real estate social networking site\u2014to get familiar with the industry. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you\u2019re feeling confident, search your favorite job boards for \u201creal estate writer\u201d titles, and submit your stuff!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4.

And, although writing about death on a daily basis might seem like it\u2019d be a dreadful job, most writers maintain that it\u2019s oddly uplifting.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Land the Gig:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breaking into the obituary writing business is similar to building up a reputation in any other freelance writing niche. You\u2019ll need to do your research, refine your skills, and then begin marketing that particular service.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, when it comes to networking in this unique industry, you can turn to the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.societyofprofessionalobituarywriters.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Society of Professional Obituary Writers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2014which will provide opportunities to learn new skills, find new resources, and attend conferences. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5.

In most cases, the most popular video games are tied together with moving narratives\u2014including heroes, villains, and plot twists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And, while inspiration for these storylines can come from everywhere, there\u2019s always someone who swoops in, polishes it up, and ties it into a narrative that users can follow when playing the game: Writers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cPeople are doing genuinely cool stuff with games as a storytelling medium right now,\u201d says Tom Bissell, the writer behind games like <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gears of War: Judgment<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.newyorker.com\/books\/page-turner\/on-video-games-and-storytelling-an-interview-with-tom-bissell\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interview with the New Yorker<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> authored by Maria Bustillos, \u201cGames, more and more, are not just about shooting and fighting, and for that reason I\u2019m optimistic and heartened about where the medium is heading, because I think game designers are getting more interested in making games that explore what it means to be alive.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>How to Land the Gig:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like many specialized fields, this can be a tough one to break into\u2014and opportunities are often few and far between.

As Johan Keyter explains in <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/artistryingames.com\/lore-writers-becoming-video-game-writer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this blog post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, write your own narratives for existing games.
