These days, most external business communications are transmitted via email, and like anything else, there&#8217;s an art to it.<br \/>\nWhen it comes to outreach to prospects\u00a0with which you do not have a relationship, your email is only as good as its open rate. People will almost always prioritize messages that come from familiar parties, so you really only have three opportunities to win strangers over in the inbox: your email address, the subject line and the preview text\u2014each of which can be leveraged to prove you deserve a chance.<br \/>\nHere are some quick tips to ensure your messages\u00a0are opened and acted upon.<\/p>\n<h3>Don&#8217;t neglect the &#8220;From&#8221; field<\/h3>\n<p>Stats from <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/get-more-email-opens-video#sm.00000r1mmv4jqifeaqdhj1myvldxo\">HubSpot<\/a> show that email addresses with your name rather than just your company\u2019s name are more likely to be opened. Even if the name itself is unknown, seeing a specific person reach out gives the receiver the impression that this isn\u2019t just another generic form email. And it should go without saying, but keep your email address professional. Nothing sketchy, provocative or sophomoric.<\/p>\n<h3>State your purpose<\/h3>\n<p>Think of puns and wordplay as a privilege you earn with time. Big brands can get away with cheesy dad jokes as subject lines because they\u2019ve already proven themselves to you; you open their emails more because of brand reputation than a funny subject line.<br \/>\nBut if you\u2019re not quite at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond level of notoriety, stick with clear subjects that tell the reader exactly what you\u2019re offering. Is it a timely pitch for a website\u2019s health vertical about Obamacare? Then don\u2019t be afraid to make the subject say exactly that. Are you following up with a past client? Then start your subject with \u201cfollowing up\u201d or \u201cchecking in.\u201d Responding to their call for submissions on Twitter? Then say so.<br \/>\nWhatever you do, don\u2019t start an email with RE: when it\u2019s your first time reaching out. It\u2019s not clever or sneaky. It\u2019s just irritating.<\/p>\n<h3>Consider the preview text<\/h3>\n<p>When composing an email, remember that the recipient can see the beginning of your message before even opening it. Use this as a chance to show that you\u2019ve done a little research by putting the recipient\u2019s name in your greeting.<br \/>\nIf you&#8217;ve done all of these things correctly, there&#8217;s a good chance your recipient has opened your email. Hooray! But don\u2019t pat yourself on the back quite yet\u2014opening and responding are two very different things and the former doesn\u2019t guarantee the latter. Here are five more tips that might get you that elusive reply.<\/p>\n<h3>Keep it short<\/h3>\n<p>People don\u2019t have time to read a tome about all of your achievements and grand schemes for their company, so opening an email and seeing a giant block of text is going to be a huge turnoff. Concise paragraphs, line breaks for visual breathing room and easy to read font will work in your favor.<br \/>\nBrevity becomes more important when you consider that <a href=\"https:\/\/litmus.com\/blog\/53-of-emails-opened-on-mobile-outlook-opens-decrease-33\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">nearly half of all emails<\/a> are read on a mobile device. Five sentences on a desktop might be manageable, but within the confines of a phone screen a few extra words can add several lines. Read (and re-read) your email and ask yourself, &#8220;Does every word count?&#8221; Remove the fluff.<\/p>\n<h3>Be your own hype-person<\/h3>\n<p>Part of your job is to sell yourself. Use a paragraph to explain your expertise, provide examples of work you\u2019ve done in the past and say how you can use your unique skill-set to benefit the company. Remember, it&#8217;s not about you, but rather what you can do to bring value to the individual and\/or his or her business goals.<br \/>\nYou\u2019ll have the most success if you show that you\u2019ve studied the company\u2019s work and have insight into why you and only you are the person they\u2019ve been looking for. Whether that\u2019s through citing a piece an editor published recently and relating it to your own idea or following up a brief critique of a company\u2019s web page design with specific suggestions for how you would improve it,\u00a0demonstrate to the recipient that you took the time to do your homework before\u00a0hitting &#8220;Send.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h3>Use links to provided context without adding length<\/h3>\n<p>If you have a portfolio, include a link. It\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019ve done something impressive, another to let them see it with their own eyes.<\/p>\n<h3>Mind your manners<\/h3>\n<p>It should be obvious, but keep your language professional, yet friendly. Get a read on the company\u2019s voice from their website or look at the recipient\u2019s Twitter account to learn their sense of humor and try to match it. If you\u2019re not sure, err on the side of caution and go formal.<\/p>\n<h3>Pick an optimal time window<\/h3>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/resources\/research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study by MailChimp<\/a> found that email open rates are best on Tuesdays and Thursdays and between 9 a.m. and 12 p.m.\u00a0Of course, the classic best practice of knowing your audience trumps this research, as compelling as it may be. Is your target a busy agency executive who arrives at the office early so he or she can reserve the evenings for family time? Schedule your note for 8 a.m. If the recipient is a known night owl who uses evenings to play catch up on email, perhaps you should hit &#8220;Send&#8221; 12 hours later.<br \/>\nOne last thing to remember: if you don\u2019t get a response, don\u2019t get discouraged. Any experienced freelancer will tell you that you can do everything right and still never hear back, so keep working and fine-tuning your approach. Most importantly, take note of\u00a0is working so you can optimize over time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Master the craft of the cold email with these easy steps.
