Just don\u2019t forget to pay your taxes!\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For me, that conversation happened late in 2013 when I was telling my mother about how well my new freelance writing and editing job was. I was playing the role of stay-at-home dad to our twin 1-year-old daughters at the time and my prime editing hours were when the girls were asleep (generally 9 p.m. &#8211; 3 a.m., my apologies to any former clients who got the 3 a.m. editing results). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">My braggadocio went out in a whiff of hot air as my mom said over the phone, \u201cThat\u2019s great, just remember about your taxes!\u201d <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Since it was over the phone, I didn\u2019t have to maintain my poker face, only my poker voice (sounds like a great sequel for Lady Gaga). \u201cOf course,\u201d I said. \u201cMy taxes, yes.\u201d<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Obviously, I had not thought about paying my taxes, which for freelancers should be paid quarterly in estimates to the IRS or all at once before the April 15 deadline. But not only did I have to pay through the nose that year, I also missed out on <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/commonly-missed-and-miscategorized-freelance-tax-deductions\/\">a ton of deductions<\/a> that could have brought that cost way down, if only I\u2019d known about <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\">how to track the expenses<\/a> involved in working for yourself. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tracking Your Expenses&#8211;No Receipts, No Write-Offs<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The government loves it when you start your own business and work for yourself. You\u2019re adding stimulus to the economy without them having to spend a dime, you\u2019re not leaching unemployment costs, and you\u2019re providing goods and\/or services to American consumers &#8211; and possibly foreign ones as well &#8211; instead of having those consumers go outside the US borders to shop.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Because of this, the government looks kindly on you when it\u2019s time to pay your taxes, but you have to be religiously dedicated to tracking those expenses if you want to guarantee them getting accepted as write-offs. If you just try to \u2018guestimate\u2019 how much you spend on advertising, marketing, or supplies and the government decides to audit you&#8230;well, you can guess how that\u2019s going to go.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Now you don\u2019t have to hire a CPA to track your expenses. There are plenty of free resources online that will get you the exact same results, without the high cost (including <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking?\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s expense tracking feature<\/a> in the app!). If you want to buy the little visor that only tax guys and poker dealers seem to wear, that\u2019s your choice.&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Once you\u2019ve missed out on keeping your expenses, even for a month, you can still file them based on what you do record, but no estimating across the entire year. If you paid $250 for Google Adwords in July, don\u2019t pretend you paid $250\/month. You need receipts to back up what you said you spent. No receipts, no write-offs.<\/span><br \/>\n<em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tax-changes-freelancers-llc-s-corp\/\">2018 Tax Policy Changes: Should Freelancers Structure as an LLC or S-Corp?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>Paying Your Freelance Taxes<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you are handling your taxes the right way, you\u2019ll take a percentage out of every dollar you make and set it aside for your taxes. To soften the blow at the end-of-the-year, you can estimate your taxes based on previous years, and sent them to the IRS in four equal payments throughout the year. But be advised, if you miss the deadlines on the IRS has for each of the quarterly payments, there\u2019s no going back. They\u2019ll still take your money, but it\u2019ll be applied to the next quarter\u2019s payment.<\/span><br \/>\nFor an estimate of your quarterly taxes, check out <a href=\"https:\/\/quarterlytaxcalculator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace&#8217;s quarterly tax calculator<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Not Paying Your Freelance Taxes (Never a Good Idea)<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If you\u2019re new to the freelancing game, you haven\u2019t ever worked for yourself before, or you haven\u2019t set aside the money to pay your income tax, you can be tempted to not file a return by April 15. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><strong>This is a terrible idea.&nbsp;<\/strong>Let&#8217;s repeat that, but with some extra emphasis:&nbsp;<em><strong>THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/em><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Just ask <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-2304705\/Wesley-Snipes-released-prison-serving-years-tax-evasion--just-weeks-tax-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wesley Snipes<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reference.com\/business-finance\/did-willie-nelson-tax-trouble-42868b80692c3b14#\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Willie Nelson<\/a>. If you know you owe money from your freelancing business, there are two easy ways to deal with it: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">File your taxes and then download a form from the IRS website which allows you to pay off the money you owe in a monthly installment plan. Make it an amount of money you can afford &#8211; they\u2019ve agreed to $100 month for me in the past. The IRS will approve you if the monthly amount is feasible &#8211; don\u2019t tell them you\u2019ll pay $5 a month &#8211; and set you up with a monthly payment like any other bill. The good news is that the payment plan won\u2019t start for a few months so you can save up to make sure you have the funds available.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">File your taxes and ask for an extension. If you do this, you\u2019ll need to send at least some money now, even if it\u2019s just $100. You then have six months to pay the remainder of your balance &#8211; that is, until October 15.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The worst thing you can do is nothing. The IRS is willing to work with most people who communicate with them and who are honest and forthcoming in their desire to do the right thing, even if they don\u2019t have the funds to do it immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>In Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The \u2018free\u2019 part of freelancing makes for a fun lifestyle where your hours, your locale, your wardrobe are really all yours to control. However, when it comes to taking care of the financial end of things you need to be far more meticulous than the average tax filer. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tell me if this sounds familiar: You set up your online profile, you start taking on some clients, the money starts coming in, you\u2019re happy, you\u2019re<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":100,"featured_media":7799,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Handle Your Freelance Business or Face a Frustrating Tax Season<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Usually, we are missing out on a ton of deductions that could have brought a lot...
