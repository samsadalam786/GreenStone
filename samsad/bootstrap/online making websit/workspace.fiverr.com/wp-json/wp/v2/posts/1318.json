Kick your game up to the next level by emulating these awesome fictional characters, who would also happen to be some amazing freelancers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Tyrion Lannister (<em>Game of Thrones<\/em>) &#8212; Freelance HR Ace?\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/awoiaf.westeros.org\/index.php\/Tyrion_Lannister\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tyrion<\/a>\u2019s obvious qualifier is his brains. If he can\u2019t recall the answer from one of the many books he\u2019s read before, he at least knows exactly where to go in order to find it. That will get anyone pretty far in the freelancing world, but Tyrion has an arguably more coveted skill\u2014 he\u2019s great with people. He had a dad and a sister that absolutely hated him, and not cracking under their endless complaints and criticisms takes a strong personality. He\u2019s a top-notch negotiator and has been able to work his way out of a number of tricky spots with a combination of wit and persuasion. He\u2019s a top notch candidate for a freelance HR position.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Dr. Frankenstein (<em>Frankenstein<\/em>) &#8212; Freelance AI<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We mean the Doctor, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Victor_Frankenstein\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Victor Frankenstein<\/a>. Not the actual monster that, in the original book, is aptly named\u2026 the monster. We\u2019ll also admit that no one really liked the monster\u2014 he was ugly, frightening, and misunderstood. But while everyone was busy judging the heck out of the fiend, they failed to recognize just how insane its existence was. Dr. Frankenstein managed to create a living, breathing creature out of lifeless parts. Playing God, Frankenstein did the seemingly impossible. It\u2019s not too crazy to imagine him in the twenty-first century, seizing every opportunity and turning so many lemons into lemonade that Beyonc\u00e9 would be jealous. Luckily he\u2019d hire out his skills to work on something a little less\u2026organic. An AI consultant, maybe?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Scheherazade (<em>One Thousand and One Nights<\/em>) &#8212; Freelance Content Writer<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This spot almost belonged to Aladdin. With a firm grasp on the importance of personal branding\u2014 seriously, did you see how he reinvented himself as royalty?\u2014 he surely had what it took to make it among other hypercompetitive freelancers. But I felt it that putting his creator on the list was way more appropriate. Yeah, the framework of the story is problematic\u2014 an insecure king has a habit of killing off a succession of young women, night after night. But the clever <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Scheherazade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scheherazade<\/a> eludes death by spending each night telling a story. Her tales are so compelling that she managed to reel off 1,001 of them (and be made the Queen, to boot). With storytelling skills that powerful, clients would scramble like crazy for her content.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Violet Baudelaire\u00a0<\/b><strong>(<em>A Series of Unfortunate Events<\/em>) &#8212; Innovator of Many Trades<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The eldest of the Baudelaire siblings, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Violet_Baudelaire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Violet<\/a> ushers her brother and sister throughout a series of unending unfortunate events. Each of them has their own unique skills, and Violet channels those of an inventor. With her characteristic ribbon holding her hair in place, she has managed to use everyday objects to create everything from a grappling hook to a battering ram. She has a knack for drumming up innovative solutions that get the job done, especially in high-pressure situations.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Oscar De L\u00e9on (<em>The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao<\/em>) &#8212; Tenacious Freelancer in the Making<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ll admit it, <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao<\/em><\/a> is a grade-A tear jerker. But just because the book won\u2019t compel you to go outside and plant sunflowers doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t recognize the one thing Oscar has that every freelancer needs\u2014 a tenacious spirit. Oscar is down on his luck in life and love, but ultimately realizes the importance of pressing on until you find what (or in his case, who) you absolutely love. As a freelancer, things can look tough sometimes\u2014you might have to weather the occasional cold period or have some issues during your first quarterly tax season. But it all pays off when you can appreciate the benefits that come with the freelance lifestyle, as you look towards a better tomorrow.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you have an Fiverr Workspace Chief Operator that takes care of some of the mind-numbing minutiae that comes with being a
