And since you\u2019re the boss, there\u2019s <em>no one else<\/em> to provide an end of year review.\u00a0<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Whether it happens or not, it\u2019s all on you. Even though you certainly don\u2019t have to do it, I challenge you to give it a try.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>While you\u2019re thinking about what happened in your business over the past year, consider making changes in terms of these six New Years resolution ideas:<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>#1: Resolve to do more networking<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you spend the majority of your time working from home, it\u2019s important to make excuses to get out of the house.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to stay energized if you isolate yourself from other people. And even if you really do your best work on your own at home, it sure can be lonely.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>But besides the benefits of togetherness you\u2019ll achieve by getting out of the house and <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-get-freelance-work-build-a-freelance-community\/\">s<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-get-freelance-work-build-a-freelance-community\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"urrounding yourself with other people (opens in a new tab)\">urrounding yourself with other people<\/a>, you may also find several business benefits.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Specifically, looking for opportunities to network can be a great way to find collaborators and business prospects, alike.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>In Denver, I get face time with other interesting people with the following involvements:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>WordCamp Denver event organization<\/li><li>WordPress Denver meetup volunteering (I\u2019ve previously been in charge of the Denver Freelancers Union chapter)<\/li><li>Member (previously board member) of The Marketing Alliance, a business marketing association<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>The best part of my involvement with each group isn\u2019t <em>just <\/em>about the fact that they provide excellent opportunities for finding well-paying clients. These networking opportunities also help me meet people who do work that complements mine.&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Once we\u2019ve met and have established trust, we can refer business back and forth. It\u2019s in situations like these that it\u2019s especially important to know and communicate your niche to the people you\u2019re networking with (and likewise ask people about what they\u2019re best at).&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You may be able to create an additional revenue stream based on commission from referring business you don\u2019t have the time or ability to do well.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t forget: freelancers, even in the same industry and niche, are your friends \u2014 not your competition. There\u2019s definitely enough work out there for all of us.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Although the Internet has made it easier for us to work and connect with others online, nothing beats an in-person connection. But even when you can\u2019t justify an in-person meeting, virtual coffee chats and mastermind groups with other similar freelancers can help you build community and avoid isolation.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself<\/strong>: which local groups could I see myself checking out to meet more people in my industry and niche?<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h2>#2: Resolve to dig into the numbers and understand cash flow<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re bringing in and spending money within your business, it will be hard to set goals to increase your revenue and profit.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Resolve to set goals for business development<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>More specifically, resolve to set numeric goals around:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>How many clients you want at one time<\/li><li>How many prospects you must interact with to close the deal, on average<\/li><li>How much money you want to make each month<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Once you have some numbers in place, follow through by tracking your efforts to get there and see how much work it really takes to achieve your earnings goals.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Resolve to start a retirement account<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>I can\u2019t emphasize this point enough \u2014&nbsp;the longer you put this off, the less you\u2019ll eventually benefit from compounding interest when you\u2019re ready to retire.&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>No one else is going to do this for you.

Cumulative learning and a deep concentration on a set of related topics ultimately leads to deep understanding.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This idea of quarterly learning sprints reminds me of the book, <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/12-Week-Year-Others-Months-ebook\/dp\/B00CU9P31K\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The 12 Week Year (opens in a new tab)\">The 12 Week Year<\/a><\/em>.

If you\u2019re not planning to use the information right away, you may want to wait on trying to learn it.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Speaking of being purposeful, if you\u2019re planning to attend any conferences or related events, the beginning of the year is the perfect time to add them to your calendar. While you\u2019re at it, block off time that\u2019s already spoken for in terms of vacation, weddings, and other important events in your personal life.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Doing this will provide a realistic look at what time you have left for everything else. In terms of conferences, this may also enable you to commit sooner \u2014 taking advantage of early bird ticket pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Additional New Years resolution ideas for learning and trying new things:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Read business books<\/li><li>Take online courses<\/li><li>Subscribe to industry newsletters<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Ask yourself<\/strong>: what big and little things do I want to learn this year?<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>#6: Resolve to use your business to make the world a better place<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>2019 sure seemed like a rough year around the world.
