We did so much testing on the Obama campaign, but I realized that everyone could be doing more testing. I decided to become a consultant to help spread the culture of testing\u2014which I am still doing now as the Co-Founder and CEO of the new boutique data firm <a href=\"https:\/\/pantheon-analytics.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pantheon Analytics<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Would you ever go back to the political sphere?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m still in the political sphere! As a freelance consultant, most of my clients were political organizations. Now, with my new role at Pantheon Analytics, we may end up having a broader client base\u2014but I suspect politics will always be our primary sector.<\/p>\n<h3>Where&#8217;s your favorite place to work?<\/h3>\n<p>My home office has a vertical monitor that I can plug my laptop into. Having that big vertical screen is so helpful for data analysis!<\/p>\n<h3>What are some of your best and worst work habits?<\/h3>\n<p>My worst work habit is being a night owl. For instance, I am writing the answers to these questions at 1:30 a.m. On the other hand, sometimes I get into a really good groove and do great work late into the night!<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s the biggest perk of working independently? What&#8217;s the hardest part?<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s amazing to have the freedom and flexibility of working independently. I get to travel when I want, set my own schedule, and choose clients I feel enthusiastic about. The hardest part is when a few contracts end concurrently and it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be renewed\/replaced. In my four years as a consultant this has happened to me a few times\u2014super stressful! But it always worked out in the end.<\/p>\n<h3>What opportunity would make you quit your independence?<\/h3>\n<p>Technically, I just did! I am now running Pantheon Analytics with my business partner, Evan Zasoski. But since Evan has always been a freelancer for the last few years, we are hoping to preserve the best aspects of freelancing in our new venture.<\/p>\n<h3>Tell us about your speaking gig at SXSW.<\/h3>\n<p>I wanted to demystify freelancing, particularly for data professionals. So, I contacted my friend Talia Borodin, who is also an independent data consultant. We decided that <a href=\"https:\/\/schedule.sxsw.com\/2017\/events\/PP68029\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hosting a meet-up<\/a> would allow for a really good discussion between ourselves, other data freelancers, and those in traditional jobs who are looking to make the leap.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s one tool or utility that you couldn&#8217;t live without?<\/h3>\n<p>Microsoft Excel. I use fancier stats software as well, of course. But Excel actually has a lot of great functionality if you deploy the right formulas and plugins.<\/p>\n<h3>What is the most important trait for freelancers and solopreneurs to have?<\/h3>\n<p>Optimism. <em>(Editor&#8217;s note: AMEN!)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>If you could be living and working in any year or era, which would you choose and why?<\/h3>\n<p>The future! Obviously we\u2019re facing some significant setbacks politically and environmentally right now. But I am hopeful that eventually we will get back on the right path.<br \/>\n<em>Know of an inspirational and interesting &#8220;hustler&#8221; among us?
