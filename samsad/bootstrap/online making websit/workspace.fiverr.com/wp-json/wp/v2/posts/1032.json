Tips: Do&#039;s and Don&#039;ts of Landing Freelance Work"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019ve been hiring freelancers for 15 years, for direct client work and agency teams. \u00a0During that time I\u2019ve recognized patterns in how successful freelancers approach winning business, and mistakes that even experienced freelancers sometimes make. \u00a0I\u2019m also a freelance project manager and UX architect, and have had developed some strategies that work well for me to continually land great contracts. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I could wax poetically with long stories, but for the Fiverr Workspace blog I thought the best way to communicate my experience was with some easy to digest bullet-point do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. \u00a0Not all of these tips works for every circumstance, and some of you may even disagree with a few of them, but I hope that the wisdom is there for you to incorporate into your own freelance quest.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O make it sound like you really are super excited to work with them and 100% want the work. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ON\u2019T fall into the trap of thinking you&#8217;re hot shit and doing them a favor by taking the work. \u00a0No matter how senior and talented you are.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">D<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">provide a fair estimate for the work based on your understanding of the scope. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T high-ball an estimate in the hopes that the sucker client will agree, or because you are super busy and want more money to fit them in your schedule. \u00a0Karma is a nasty bitch, this I\u2019ve learned in spades.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ask nicely for more detail to refine your estimate. \u00a0Explain that the more they can tell you up-front, it will help bring the costs down overall.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T immediately <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">high-ball an estimate because of too many unknowns.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO figure out what the fair market hourly rate is for your skill-set and experience is in that city. \u00a0Charge that rate. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T overinflate your hourly rate, it\u2019s an immediate red flag, especially for the agencies who work with many freelancers. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ask the client if they have a budget or range in mind. \u00a0This always helps in figuring out if you want this work or not and providing them a bid that will win the biz. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T provide an estimate blind with no idea even what range the client\u2019s budget is.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">make the client feel like they are going to be your main priority. \u00a0You should simply evaluate their needs, and figure out if you have time to be successful. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If yes and you want the project, communicate immediately that you absolutely have the availability to take on the project. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T tell the client that you are super busy, but \u201cmight\u201d be able to fit them in. \u00a0The client should never know about your overall workload, or your other current clients. \u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO ensure your Linkedin profile and your portfolio website are up to date. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T tell the client you\u2019ve been too busy to update these, it just communicates immediately that you\u2019re lazy and don\u2019t have your shit together.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO have a way to take credit card payments ready and available. \u00a0Many clients prefer to pay this way. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T force the client to send you a paper check if they prefer to pay with a credit card, it will almost certainly delay payment. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO have your own client-friendly task management platform ready and available for your projects. \u00a0Think Basecamp, Asana, Trello or similar. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T come unprepared with only email as an option for the client to communicate with you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO have your own stable of freelancers in many skill-sets that you like to partner up with or refer into jobs. \u00a0Let the client know you have a team of other freelancers you can bring onto the project if they have any other requirements. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T be a freelance island who doesn\u2019t know any other freelancers. \u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO accept whatever standard payment terms a reputable company, agency or recruiter communicates to you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T ask for an unreasonable payment up front, as most reputable companies have a 30-day net payment policy and it takes time to run invoices through their system. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO ask for money up front if you are at all unsure about the client\u2019s ability to pay you. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T do a bunch of work with a sketchy client without a deposit. \u00a0Don\u2019t deliver final root files or code without full payment if it\u2019s a sketchy client.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO tell stories about how things have worked well with other clients in the past.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be negative about any previous clients to prove a point, or head off an issue. \u00a0In the end that sounds like gossip and negativity, and can turn clients off.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO recognize that you are an independent and not part of the company you are doing work for. \u00a0Be Switzerland, be positive, contribute solutions that are a win-win for everyone.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T get involved in your client\u2019s internal gossip or company politics. \u00a0I\u2019ve seen this kind of behavior ensure the freelancer never gets hired again, even when the actual work is top notch.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO meet with the client in person if that\u2019s an option. \u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If I&#8217;ve met with one freelancer in person, and just had phone calls with a few others, I&#8217;m more likely to pick the person I met with in person all other things being equal. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T turn down an opportunity to meet in person if you can swing it.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO be plug and play on an agency sub-contract gig. \u00a0This means try your hardest to be self-sufficient and conscious of their time. \u00a0Ask for all the projects documents that you can read to get up to speed. \u00a0Ask for access to the project task area so you can read all the previous items the team has worked on. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T bother your agency team with too many unnecessary questions, especially at the beginning of a project.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO dress at least business casual if you are going to meet a client or work onsite. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T be a slob. \u00a0While it shouldn\u2019t really matter, it does. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DO offer to pay if you are meeting your client for coffee or lunch. \u00a0They should pay, but it\u2019s always great to offer.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DON\u2019T expect your client to pay, or indicate that they should.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I hope that these do\u2019s and don\u2019t were valuable to you!
