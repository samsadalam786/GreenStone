The world we live in belongs to the 9-to-5ers with their routines, their cliches (TGIF!), and their rituals celebrating work-life achievements. If it&#8217;s co-worker&#8217;s birthday, there&#8217;s cake. If a co-worker gets a promotion, there&#8217;s cake. If co-worker\u00a0leaves the company, there&#8217;s&#8230;cake. Well what about us freelancers? Do people think we don&#8217;t like cake? Why must we be the Jan to the\u00a09-to-5 ers&#8217; Marcia?<br \/>\nThere are amazing things that happen to freelancers every day like finishing a very important project, landing a new client, and\u00a0cashing your\u00a0first real paycheck. We deserve to celebrate in our own way. Here&#8217;s a list of ways to rock out when you achieve your freelance goals.<\/p>\n<h2>Pop Bottles When It Works For You!<\/h2>\n<p>You know the saying &#8220;it&#8217;s 5 o&#8217;clock somewhere&#8221;? Well, every freelancer should have that on a t-shirt. We don&#8217;t need to wait to happy hour for a toast.\u00a0We make our own rules. So, if something BIG happens and you deserve a glass of champagne, go for it. Even if it&#8217;s 11:00Am because 1.) there are things called mimosas and 2.) IT&#8217;S 5 O&#8217;CLOCK SOMEWHERE!<\/p>\n<h2>Get Yourself Freelance Swag<\/h2>\n<p>Holding off on getting that\u00a0laptop case you&#8217;ve always wanted? Well, after you&#8217;ve met a goal, there&#8217;s nothing better than treating yourself. You can even do like Donna &amp; Tom a la NBC&#8217;s sorely missed Parks &amp; Recreation and do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=iOazGVaybe4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Treat Yo Self<\/a> day! There&#8217;s so much swag for freelance life, it&#8217;s time for you to get yourself something nice. Check out this list of goodies that&#8217;ll make ya drool.<\/p>\n<h2>Give Yourself a Tech Break<\/h2>\n<p>As freelancers, being connected is extremely important. We need to be on emails all the time because unlike some common occupations, we have to take our job home and to a restaurant and out with friends&#8230;you get the picture. We don&#8217;t know when we will hear a buzz and it will be our next big gig. So let go of the fear and live in the moment. Put down the phone, go for a walk, and be. It&#8217;s a celebration of you, promise.<\/p>\n<h2>Go To The GOOD Coffee Spot<\/h2>\n<p>We all do it, buy the cheapest drink on the menu so that we can hunker down un-interrupted at the coffee shop. And while we are sipping on what could be hot garbage, we dream of our favorite cup of joe that&#8217;s just a tad overpriced.<br \/>\nNot today. Go get yourself the brew your want. Make it a large. Add whipped cream. No. Holds. Barred.<\/p>\n<h2>Vacation? You Earned One, Freelancer<\/h2>\n<p>If you hit a ton of your goals and feel like you&#8217;re in a place for a vacation, staycation, or weekend getaway then start to consider it. You don&#8217;t need to ask for vacay days baby, you got em.<\/p>\n<h2>No Traditional Co-Workers? No Problem!<\/h2>\n<p>9-to-5ers celebrate together often. Believe me, I used to be a 9-t0-5er. For every celebration, my fabulous former co-worker made the most amazing brownies in the world. This is not an exaggeration. I&#8217;d want these brownies to be my last meal. So if there&#8217;s one thing I miss about my office job it&#8217;s that. If there&#8217;s two things, it&#8217;s celebrating the little and the big accomplishments with the people you see every day.<br \/>\nAs freelancers, it&#8217;s important to remember that we can celebrate our achievements with loved ones. What you&#8217;re doing as a freelancer is so cool to most people with 9-to-5 jobs that they want to hear what you&#8217;re doing and party with you.\u00a0Not only that, you can find other freelancers and\u00a0connect. Get into a space where you&#8217;re all comfortable to share your achievements as they come and celebrate them together! We all need a lil&#8217; love and lots of brownies sometimes.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s no reason we shouldn&#8217;t pat ourselves on our backs when we do something great. Every step we take is another step to secure our careers as freelancers and that&#8217;s something to celebrate. Sure, we might be the Jan and not the Marcia but honestly, don&#8217;t we all want to be the Jan anyway? She strayed off the beaten path.<br \/>\nHey Jan Brady, we can relate.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Let&#8217;s face it.
