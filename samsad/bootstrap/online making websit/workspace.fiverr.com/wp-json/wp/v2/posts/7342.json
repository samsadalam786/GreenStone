But getting new clients over and over again each month is just outright exhausting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, to save your sanity and grow your business with less effort, you\u2019ve got to think long-term when it comes to clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today, I\u2019d like to share how you can turn one-time job listings into long-term freelance clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s something we teach to our members at <a href=\"https:\/\/solidgigs.com\">SolidGigs<\/a> (our job-finding community for freelancers) and hundreds of freelancers have had major success converting one-time listings into long-term clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>1. Change how you think about job listings<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you have to change how you think about job listings. Here\u2019s the biggest mindset change that will greatly impact your ability to find long-term clients:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>A job listing doesn\u2019t have to say \u201cfreelance\u201d to be a potential client<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re only searching for freelance job listings that specifically ask for a freelancer or a contractor, you\u2019re missing out on a lot of opportunities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put yourself in the position of a potential hirer for just a moment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a problem that needs solved. Work that needs to be done. And most likely, they have a budget for which the work can be completed (the new employee\u2019s salary or hourly wage).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That all works in your favor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, many times you can convince someone trying to hire a part-time employee that hiring a contractor or freelancer is better. Here are just a few ideas you can use when pitching someone on hiring a freelancer instead of an employee:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>They can send you more work (longer hours) without having to pay health benefits.<\/li><li>They only pay for the work you complete (no watercooler cost).<\/li><li>They save money on overhead (your desk, computer, office supplies, etc.)<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/hiring-managers-tell-get-freelance-job\/\">Lots of employers are hiring freelancers<\/a> more often for these and many more reasons. Which creates an excellent opportunity for you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because these potential employers have a long-term problem they need solved with a long-term employee, they\u2019re a natural fit for a long-term client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings me to my next point:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Aim for clients who are good long-term candidates<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, someone who\u2019s trying to hire a part- or full-time employee makes a pretty great candidate for a long-term client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other client types that lend themselves to the likelihood of a long-term relationship too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to identify these clients, you\u2019ll need to earnestly think through the situation a potential hirer may find themselves in. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I\u2019m saying:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Good long-term candidate<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Unlikely to become a long-term client<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Someone with a recurring problem that needs solved.<\/strong> <br>ie: a small business that needs a new blog post published every Monday morning.<\/td><td><strong>Someone that has one small problem to be solved only right now.<br><\/strong>ie: a small business that needs an email signature template designed for all its employees.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Someone with an established business and proven revenue model.<\/strong>ie: a business that has been around for at least a few years and has a handful or more of employees.<\/td><td><strong>Someone just getting started with their business or idea.<\/strong>ie: your friend who has a great idea for a new app but isn\u2019t quitting his day job quite yet.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Someone with a long-term budget.<\/strong>ie: a business owner who wants to hire a part-time social media marketer for the foreseeable future.<\/td><td><strong>Someone who nickels and dimes you on your first project.<\/strong>ie: potential clients who spend dozens of emails negotiating your rates before you even begin their project.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m not saying the clients on the right can\u2019t provide a quality experience or portfolio pieces. They may be a good fit if you\u2019ve never freelanced before and you just need to get your feet wet.<br>But if you\u2019re ready to take your freelance business to a more predictable, successful level, then you\u2019ll want to focus on clients similar to the ones found on the left in the table above.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll find it\u2019s much easier to convert these kinds of clients to long-term business (step 4).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Add immense value to new clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know the biggest mistake people make when asking their boss for a raise? It\u2019s that they blind-side them. They walk into their boss\u2019s office asking for more money out of the blue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>(I know we\u2019re talking about freelancing here, but stick with me. This will be super helpful when I tie it all back together.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the smartest and most talented negotiators I know of, Ramit Sethi, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com\/blog\/salary-negotiation\/\">explains<\/a> this important point when asking for a raise:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to getting a raise is remembering that it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about what you can do for your employer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t tell them you need more money because your expenses are high. Nobody cares. BUT you can show how your work has clearly been contributing to the company\u2019s success and ask to be compensated fairly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why <strong>three months before you ask for a raise, you\u2019re going to start tracking everything you do at work and the results you get<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, converting one-time jobs into long-term clients works exactly the same way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can\u2019t just blindside your client with a request for ongoing revenue every month when you haven\u2019t proven your contribution to your client\u2019s success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>99% of the time, you\u2019ll fail. They\u2019ll tell you they can\u2019t afford to bring you on as a regular freelancer or pay you each month for regular work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is: they probably <em>can<\/em> afford it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to business, if you bring a positive ROI for an employer they can <em>always<\/em> afford it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your first and most important task is to: <strong>Add immense value to your client\u2019s business.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Track that value where possible. Highlight it frequently. Ensure your client sees just how vital your work is to their business\u2019 success. Be invested in your client\u2019s success.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can do that, the next steps (where we convert clients to long-term business partnerships) becomes infinitely easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent interview we did with agency builder and Emmy-award winning designer <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/chris-do-interview\">Chris Do<\/a>, he reminded us:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t learn the language of business, you may limit your growth and be relegated to the role of an &#8216;order taker&#8217;.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Identify the best moments for pitching a long-term relationship.<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019re sure you\u2019ve added actual value to your client\u2019s business, it\u2019s time to identify the right moment to pitch a long-term relationship.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this can be a lot like dating. If you come at it too soon, you might scare them away. If you take too long, they might just forget about you and move on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timing is everything.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are just a few moments that work well for pitching a long-term client\/freelancer relationship:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At the beginning of a project<\/strong> when you\u2019re identifying the scope of the work. You might say something like:<br><em> \u201cThis sounds great. And it looks like it might require some updates every couple of weeks, which I\u2019d be happy to help with on a recurring basis as well. Would you be open to an arrangement like that?<\/em>&#8220;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the middle of a project <\/strong>when you\u2019re both enjoying working together and your client can see how much value you\u2019re adding. You might try something like:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThis first portion went really smoothly and I can see it\u2019s performing really well for you. Maybe we ought to think about a more long-term setup where I can help you get results like this on a regular basis. Would that be interesting to you at all?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At the conclusion of a project <\/strong>when your client is super-satisfied with your work and excited about results. Your conversation might look like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cThat wraps up this project. Thanks so much! I\u2019d love to chat about ways we could work together more regularly in the future so we can keep driving results for you. Is that something you\u2019d want to discuss this week?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A while after the project has concluded <\/strong>and results are in. You might try pitching along these lines:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cI see the project went live and has really over-delivered for your customers. That\u2019s fantastic! I\u2019d love to chat about hitting these kinds of numbers on a regular basis together. Sound interesting?\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However you phrase it, use conversational language and just gauge interest. Once you\u2019ve got someone interested you can talk details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Remember, \u201cno\u201d doesn\u2019t mean forever<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your client turns you down on your first pitch, remember: it\u2019s not the end of the world.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this client is still a good match (you work well together, they seem to have budget and repeat work, etc.) then don\u2019t give up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could be that, at the moment, they can only send you one-off jobs but as their business grows they\u2019ll find more budget for more regular freelance work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps they have an overstaffed team right now, but when someone leaves, they\u2019ll have a gap in workload they\u2019d like to fill with a freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to remain positive, always offering to support and help and therefore remaining top-of-mind for when the perfect moment arises.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to bring it up multiple times too. My friend <a href=\"https:\/\/businessbitch.com\/\">Chelsea Baldwin<\/a> who has built a thriving copywriting agency using these methods told me:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you have an idea [of how to add value on a recurring basis], just pitch the idea. I tell freelancers to just put a pitch for a retainer in every proposal that they write.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep it low key and low-stress so they don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re pushing them real hard. Some people will buy into it; some people won\u2019t. But it puts the idea there in front of them.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at the end of the project or when you\u2019re close to the end of the project, you can pitch the idea again.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5. Continue to add value and renegotiate when the time is right<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you manage to convert a one-time client into recurring business, then congratulations! You\u2019ve made it a lot farther than many freelancers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019re well on your way to building <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/freelancing-business-setting-career-goals\/\">a sustainable freelance business<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal now becomes to continue to add value to your current client roster as much as possible (which should be fairly straightforward since you don\u2019t have to spend hours every week hunting and begging for new freelance jobs).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use an app like AND.CO, you can even <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/recurring-payments\">set up recurring payments<\/a> so your client\u2019s account is just billed automatically every month and you never have to stress again about <a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/getting-paid-as-a-freelancer\">getting paid as a freelancer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s kind of amazing, honestly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you continue to add value, keep pitching new ideas, higher rates, and more ways you can add value to your client\u2019s business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, you can repeat the process above to negotiate a higher monthly retainer or more billable hours from your clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>That\u2019s it\u2026<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Turning one-time clients into recurring revenue can really be that simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over time, you\u2019ll learn how to get better at the timing, the pitch, and the negotiations. But for now: just give it a try.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have a lot to lose, honestly. If a one-time client declines a recurring relationship, you\u2019ve still got the original one-time project you agreed to, so you\u2019re not out anything but maybe the time you spent discussing it with them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the upside is huge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recurring revenue can be the thing that changes your freelance career from stressful, painful and wondering if you should just \u201cget another job already\u201d to working on projects you love, having time fly by, and maybe even <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-subcontract-work-to-grow-your-freelance-business\/\">subcontracting as a way to grow your freelance business<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However you go about it\u2014or whatever your motivations are\u2014I sincerely wish you the best of luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After working with freelancers for more than a decade, the biggest complaint I still hear over and over again is how hard it is to find<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":110,"featured_media":10214,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>How to turn one-time job listings into long-term freelance clients<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"To vacation or not to vacation?
