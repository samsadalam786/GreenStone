Whether you\u2019re&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/8-skills-to-master-your-first-30-days-freelancer\/\">just getting started as a freelancer<\/a>&nbsp;or have been at it for years, numbers are critical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For freelancers, perhaps the three most important numbers are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How many&nbsp;<strong>hours<\/strong>&nbsp;(H) do you spend on each project?&nbsp;<\/li><li>What are the total&nbsp;<strong>expenses<\/strong>&nbsp;(E) on each project?<\/li><li>How much&nbsp;<strong>revenue<\/strong>&nbsp;(R) do you receive for each project?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With those two numbers alone, you can calculate quite a few important strategies for your business such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What\u2019s my average hourly rate?&nbsp;<\/strong><strong>Should I raise my rates?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>(R &#8211; E) \/ H = Your average hourly rate (Y).

You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/7-simple-calculations-every-freelancer-should-make\/\">dive even deeper<\/a>&nbsp;if you want to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why do so many freelancers fail to know their numbers?

Or at least it can be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Mastering Your Time as a Freelancer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you offer a service to clients as most freelancers do,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-save-time-and-make-more-money-with-a-freelance-time-tracker\/\">your most valuable and important resource is time<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\u2019t have to tell you: time is finite. And it can be easy to lose track of time, spending far more than you should on certain projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you need to get meticulous about tracking your time as a freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Better time-tracking = Higher productivity<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Studies show tracking your time can lead to higher productivity. If you only give yourself an hour to accomplish a task, it\u2019s a lot harder to take all afternoon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.replicon.com\/case-study\/fisher-vista\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">One study<\/a>&nbsp;showed an increase in productivity when workers utilized time-tracking as a measuring stick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Better time-tracking = Higher revenue<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That same study explained workers who utilized time-tracking also saw more timely and accurate billing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, more accurate billing can mean higher revenues for your business. It\u2019s easy to let long meetings or other admin work&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/should-you-bill-your-freelance-clients-for-meeting-time-and-other-misc-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slip through the cracks<\/a>&nbsp;if you don\u2019t have a solid time-tracking system in place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These untracked hours can lead to a loss in revenue each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>How to simplify (and actually succeed at) time-tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefits of time-tracking are obvious. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it any easier to actually track your time each month.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do that, you\u2019ll need a fail-safe system in place.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might set a calendar reminder every hour to&nbsp;catch up on your timesheets&nbsp;and make sure they\u2019re accurate\u2014just until you get into the habit.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">the AND.CO time tracker<\/a>, you\u2019ll also have a list of saved activities to choose from each time you switch tasks\u2014which will save you time and headache.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the AND.CO tool can automatically include your tracked hours directly on invoices to clients so you\u2019re sure to get paid on time, every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Clarifying Important Expenses as a Freelancer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hours you work are the most important \u201cexpense\u201d you\u2019ll face as a freelancer. But that doesn\u2019t mean some projects won\u2019t also have other expenses that need to be tracked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s your job to clarify and organize other business expenses. This helps you pass along project costs to clients, keep your spending in check, and can also&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/10-tax-breaks-that-freelancers-should-take-advantage-of\/\">save you tons of money on taxes<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Better expense-tracking = Covering your project costs<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember our formulas at the beginning of this article? If you don\u2019t know what \u201cother\u201d expenses you\u2019re incurring on your client projects, you can easily eat up all your profit even if you\u2019re charging good rates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These expenses\u2014the costs of completing a client project\u2014should be&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/pro-freelancer-fundamentals-proposal-customization\/\">worked into your proposals<\/a>&nbsp;and be paid for by the client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Better expense-tracking = Big savings at tax time<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only should you protect your profit by passing along expenses to clients, but you can also save tons of money on your taxes if you&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/faq.and.co\/en\/articles\/2721757-which-expense-category-should-i-use\">categorize your expenses correctly<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are deductions you can get&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/commonly-missed-tax-deductible-expenses-for-your-home-office\/\">for home office expenses<\/a>&nbsp;as well as marketing, technology, software, and lots more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Simplifying expense-tracking<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any time you drive to a client meeting, you should catalog that as an expense.&nbsp;When you have to buy something (physical or digital) to complete a client project,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/should-you-save-your-receipts-as-a-freelancer\/\">you should save the receipt<\/a>&nbsp;and catalog that as an expense too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, let\u2019s face it, that\u2019s a lot of work. It\u2019s tedious. And while it sounds great to save money or pass along costs, sometimes we\u2019re just flat out too tired, lazy or busy to make it happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\">simplified the process in the AND.CO app<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to expenses when using AND.CO, it\u2019s very straightforward. You have 3 options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Import your Credit Card and bank account transactions automatically.<\/li><li>Forward email receipts to file them in the app.<\/li><li>Use the AND.CO mobile app to take a picture of any other receipts.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, all your expenses can be categorized, organized, and optimized to boost your profit.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>It\u2019s all about habits<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving your time- and expense-tracking skills really comes down to one simple thing: your habits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until your brain does it on autopilot, set reminders, post sticky notes, or tie a string around your finger (whatever works for you) to remember to track your time and expenses accurately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, remember that the point of time- and expense-tracking is to save you time, help you be more productive, and boost your overall revenue.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experiment with the advice in this article and adjust our tips to meet your business\u2019 needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A number of years ago, you (like a lot of people around the world) might have gotten caught up in the&nbsp;Shark Tank&nbsp;craze.&nbsp;
