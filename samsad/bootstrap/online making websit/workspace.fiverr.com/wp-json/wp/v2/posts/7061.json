Some tactics might differ between these two people&#8211;but I&#8217;ll point those out where it matters.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Be very clear about what you&#8217;re looking for.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking for freelance work!&#8221;<\/em> isn&#8217;t good enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s too broad, and it forces people you&#8217;re messaging to burn extra brain cells trying to figure out how to help you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it easy for people to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-freelancers-can-maximize-their-word-of-mouth-potential\/\">refer you!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I made this mistake early on in my outreach, but was fortunate that one person I reached out to came back with <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s an ideal client for you?&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This forced me to get clear about what type of work I want.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your ultimate goal is to plant very <em>specific<\/em> seeds in the minds of people in your network (individuals, brands, existing clients, etc).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody should know <em>exactly <\/em>what you do and what you&#8217;re looking for&#8211;so when an opportunity <em>does <\/em>pop up, they&#8217;ll think of you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Be the &#8220;SEO audit guy!&#8221;<\/li><li>Be the &#8220;Pinterest VA friend.&#8221;<\/li><li>Be the &#8220;freelance writer in the mortgage &amp; finance space.&#8221;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Action Item: Write out what you&#8217;re after.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sit down and write out the 2-3 specific freelance gigs you&#8217;re looking to obtain, and also write out your &#8220;ideal client.&#8221; What industries? What size company? Contract or part-time work? Etc.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Take a shotgun approach to outreach, not a sniper rifle approach.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cast a wide net.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t put all your eggs in one basket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>#MetaphorsGalore<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as you might hate it, finding quality, high-paying clients will always take <em>time. <\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Make introductions<\/li><li>Get referrals<\/li><li>Determine the scope of work<\/li><li>Settle on fees\/rates<\/li><li>Get assignments<\/li><li>Do the work<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the entire &#8220;pipeline&#8221; from start to finish.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to get work fast, your objective should be to <em>start <\/em>the pipeline with as many clients as possible!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This maximizes the chances that you&#8217;ll stumble upon an immediate referral.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others will take longer, some won&#8217;t pan out at all, but the problem is that it&#8217;s impossible to guess which freelancing leads are which!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reaching out and connecting with as many people as possible (across different industries and niches) helps solve this problem.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can always filter leads out later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Note: If you&#8217;re not looking to get a gig ASAP, the sniper rifle approach might actually be more effective for getting the perfect client!<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Action Item: Make an outreach &#8220;hitlist.&#8221;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first thing I did last week: I made a list of contacts, friends, and even family members that I wanted to reach out to.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Other freelancers I know<\/li><li>Past freelance clients<\/li><li>Friends who might know anybody<\/li><li>Past podcast guests<\/li><li>Etc.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Ask for referrals, not work!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I once heard the following expression as it relates to selling things over the internet:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large\"><p>&#8220;If you want advice, ask for sales. If you want sales, ask for advice.&#8221;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how our brains shut down when we think we&#8217;re being &#8220;sold to.&#8221; It&#8217;s tough for us to remain objective!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve taken this same approach to freelance clients, and it&#8217;s worked.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three huge benefits to starting your freelance client search by asking for referrals, rather than directly reaching out for work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>It&#8217;s a friendly conversation (allowing you to reach out to friends &amp; family, in addition to brands!)<\/li><li>It takes the pressure off whoever you&#8217;re connecting with<\/li><li>Referrals are totally awesome.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, if the company you&#8217;re reaching out to is looking for somebody like you anyways, you&#8217;ve now just presented yourself on a silver platter without begging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boom. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re looking for some outreach templates to ask for referrals, check out <\/em><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"this article (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/service\/how-to-get-referrals\" target=\"_blank\"><em>this article<\/em><\/a><em>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Action Item: Outline the message\/email that you&#8217;re going to blast out to people.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Write out a templated email (be sure to adapt it and customize for each recipient!), or make a script or outline if you&#8217;re using other forms of communication.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make it casual, yet professional.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Pro tip hack: Utilize video messages &amp; images<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everybody&#8217;s inbox and Instagram messages are filled to the brim these days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better way to stand out, get your message noticed, and cement a picture of yourself in your future client&#8217;s mind&#8211;than by sending a video.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only does it stand out, but it&#8217;s way more personal, and it allows you to get your message across <em>faster <\/em>than typing a 1,439-word email.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.loom.com\/share\/083666bd694b44aebcecab8b653ec249\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> <p><strong>Here\u2019s a sample video similar to what I sent to all my contacts, asking for referrals:<\/strong><\/p> <img style=\"max-width:300px\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.loom.com\/sessions\/thumbnails\/083666bd694b44aebcecab8b653ec249-with-play.gif\"> <\/a>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend you use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.loom.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Loom (opens in a new tab)\">Loom<\/a>. It&#8217;s free, simple to set up, and simple to use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional tips:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Don&#8217;t worry about perfect lighting or sound (as long it&#8217;s watchable).<\/li><li>Do keep it casual &amp; friendly!<\/li><li>Do know what you&#8217;re going to say <em>before <\/em>you hit record.<\/li><li>Do be clear about what you want them to <strong>do<\/strong> <em>(even if it&#8217;s just &#8220;think of me if you hear of any opportunities&#8221;)<\/em><\/li><li>Do smile \ud83d\ude03<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This personal touch will go a long way!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Pro Tip:<\/strong> Even if you don&#8217;t use video, simply sending an image of any type is a good way to draw more attention and stand out, as long as the image is 100% relevant to the person you&#8217;re reaching out to, your message, etc.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bonus Tip: Ask permission to send your main question.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I rarely send cold outreach emails without asking permission first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, this sets up the video response (making it less awkward for everybody), and for two, it gives your contact an &#8220;out&#8221; should they really not have the time to respond to you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Send a quick note simply asking permission for 2-3 minutes of their time, <strong>and make it clear you&#8217;re not actually pitching them anything!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Build a network beforehand.<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, this is totally a cop-out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a network of influencers, contacts, marketing reps, and other freelancers will take a long time&#8211;so this tip isn&#8217;t immediately helpful or actionable for brand-new freelancers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>However, maintaining a long-term strategy of <\/strong><em><strong>building relationships <\/strong><\/em><strong>can be a crucial point to generating freelance client leads in bulk&#8211;and <\/strong><em><strong>fast.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should absolutely make friend-building &amp; connection-cultivating part of your long-term business strategy (and goes double for freelancing)!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Connect with people on Twitter (you can use tools like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Followerwonk (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/followerwonk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Followerwonk<\/a> to conduct more advanced searches)<\/li><li>Keep in contact with your friends on LinkedIn<\/li><li>Engage with the brands and people you follow on Instagram.<\/li><li>Do free freelance work.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/start-freelance-writing\/\">If you&#8217;re getting started in freelance writing and have zero network, read this guide!<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Invest the time and energy required to build long-term friends in the industries you are apart of. It&#8217;ll pay off when you do need to blast out a message that you&#8217;re looking for freelance clients!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Re-read that. It&#8217;s important.\ud83d\udc46<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bonus Tip #6: Follow-up!<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you have a huge network, and you&#8217;re shotgunning a message asking for referrals, you won&#8217;t always get leads immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s what follow-ups are for \ud83d\ude09<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re using a spreadsheet tracker, or an &#8220;outreach hitlist&#8221; as discussed earlier, you can write out the date you reached out to people, and then double-back and track who you&#8217;ve followed up with later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3>Have you seen quick results looking for fast freelance clients?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drop us a comment below and let us know your tips!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Looking for freelance clients?
