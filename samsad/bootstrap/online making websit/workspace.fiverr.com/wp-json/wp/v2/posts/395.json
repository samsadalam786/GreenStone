However, if you let it sit on the back burner, you\u2019d be making a very big mistake. Retirement savings are essential if you want to avoid working very late in life on things you don\u2019t want to work on just to stay alive. They\u2019re also essential if you want to leave something behind for your loved ones or avoid poverty in your late years. Add in the fact that most people are living longer and retirement becomes a huge concern.<br \/>\nWe know how important saving for retirement is, but humans have a big blind spot about problems that are way off in the future. When you\u2019re young and retirement is 40-50 years away, it seems that there\u2019s all the time in the world to save for retirement. And besides, isn\u2019t covering other essentials and saving up for that vacation more important now?<br \/>\nWe believe saving for retirement is an essential, and here\u2019s why.<\/p>\n<h2>Compound Interest for Freelancers<\/h2>\n<p>Saving for retirement all boils down to taking advantage of compound interest. By taking a very small nest egg and putting into a retirement account for decades, you can grow quite a sum of money that you can then use to retire. Let\u2019s take a simple example of compound interest to show how this works.<br \/>\nLet\u2019s say you put $100 into an account that pays 10% interest per year (keeps the math simple.) After a year in the account, that $100 will earn $10 (10% of 100), for a total of $110.<br \/>\nThe next year, the interest increases to $11 (10% of 110), and the next to $12.10 (10% of $121).<br \/>\nAfter ten years, the account will be at $259.37, more than double the initial deposit. After twenty, $672.75.<br \/>\nAnd if you were smart and invested just $100 in this account at age 25 and left it till age 65, you\u2019d have an ending balance of $4,525.93!<br \/>\nThink you can\u2019t afford to slip in $100 a month into a retirement account now? The earlier you start saving, the more your money has a chance to grow. It doesn\u2019t take much to net a tidy sum and most people don\u2019t make just one deposit. They make deposits month after month. If you put in $100 a month into your 10% account every month for 40 years ($48,000), you\u2019d have $584,222.17 at retirement! Even if was just a 5% return, you\u2019d still make $292,111.09.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s very instructive to play around with a compound interest calculator and see how much you can earn over time. You can find one at MoneyChimp and many other places on the web. The point is that the earlier you start socking away money, even if it\u2019s just $50 when you can, you will get a significant jump start on your retirement that starting late.<\/p>\n<h2>Too Late to Save? Incorrect, My Freelance Friend<\/h2>\n<p>But what if you did start late? This is the other big excuse you\u2019ll hear from both freelancers and even employees. They might think they missed their big compound interest window and now it\u2019s not worth the hassle. This is another huge mistake.<br \/>\nAny retirement saving is better than no retirement saving. There are things you can do later in life like delay your retirement date to give you more time on your accounts. A good financial advisor can also help you maximize the time that you have so you can get the most return on your money.<br \/>\nAlso, older people often have an advantage over their younger counterparts. They know what their true expenses are and aren\u2019t spending as much on frivolous things. Tightening the belt now for a comfortable retirement later isn\u2019t necessarily seen as a bad thing.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers beware<\/h2>\n<p>One of the problems specific to freelancers and other self-employed people is managing their retirement accounts. When you work for an employer, they handle most of the plan for you. At most, you might select the specific blend of investments or even choose individual funds for your accounts, but everything else is handled by the employer. As a freelancer, it\u2019s all on you to set up the accounts and maintain them, but you get a bonus. Self-employed people can deposit more money into most retirement accounts yearly than employees. Plus, you get access to the same retirement plans.<br \/>\nUnderstanding the different retirement plans isn\u2019t hard, but it does require study. The basic procedure is this. First, you deposit money into a retirement account where it earns interest. After retirement, which usually has to be after age 59 \u00bd, you can withdraw the money. That\u2019s when you\u2019ll have to pay taxes, but because you\u2019re earning less your overall tax burden should be lower.<br \/>\nWith these basics in mind, here are some different types of retirement plans that work best for freelancers:<br \/>\n<strong>IRA (Individual Retirement Arrangement)<\/strong><br \/>\nAn IRA is a method for saving for retirement when you don\u2019t have access to an employer 401(k) plan. You can save up to $5000 per year, plus an extra $1000 per year if you\u2019re over 50. The withdrawal date is at 59 \u00bd. Note that your contributions may be tax-deductible! Speak with one of the Fiverr Workspace advisors for further information on this important point.<br \/>\n<strong>Roth IRA<\/strong><br \/>\nA Roth IRA is like a traditional IRA, but you pay taxes on your deposits first. That way, when you withdraw you won\u2019t have to pay taxes at all. The deposit maximums are largely the same unless you have a lot of income or you also have a traditional IRA. You will also need to start the account before you reach age 54 \u00bd to avoid possible penalties. If you make a lot of money and can afford the extra taxes, a Roth IRA can help you reduce taxes later in life.<br \/>\n<strong>SEP (Simplified Employee Pension Plan) IRA<\/strong><br \/>\nYou can contribute a lot more per year to a SEP IRA than a traditional IRA, but the amount varies depending on how much you earn. The top maximum is $50,000. SEP IRA contributions are tax-deductible. All else is the same. Speak with an accountant to find out what your maximum contribution might be or consult IRS publication 560.<br \/>\n<strong>SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) IRA<\/strong><br \/>\nThis plan was designed for an employer and employees, but you can set one up for yourself. The SIMPLE gives you a limit of $11,500 per year, plus an additional $2,500 if you\u2019re age 50 or older. If you ever plan on hiring employees, it will be easy to add them to your plan but you will need to pay 3% on their contributions.<br \/>\nTwo other retirement plans you may want to look at are the solo 401(k) plan and the Keogh plan. These plans let you save much more than an IRA, but they are much more complex and have higher fees than IRAs. If you are making enough that you\u2019re nearing your maximum contributions on your IRAs, speak with an accountant about whether these plans might be a good addition to your retirement portfolio.<br \/>\nIn fact, before opening any retirement account you will want to speak with an accountant. your contribution limits might change depending on whether you or your spouse have additional retirement plans. Plus, you\u2019ll need to know what documentation you\u2019ll need to keep for your taxes.<br \/>\nOpening an IRA account of any type is pretty straightforward. Most banks will let you do it for a small minimum deposit and a bit of paperwork.<br \/>\nThere\u2019s no excuse for not saving for retirement. Even setting just $50 a month now can get you peace of mind for your retirement years. Speak with your Fiverr Workspace about what retirement plan may be best for you. Don\u2019t let the freedom of your freelancing years blind you to what you need to do to have a comfortable retirement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the initial throes of setting up a freelancing business, saving for retirement may be the last thing on your mind.
