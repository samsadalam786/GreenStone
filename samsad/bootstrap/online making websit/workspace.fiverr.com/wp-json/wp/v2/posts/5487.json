In short, these people had put too many eggs in one client basket, a surefire recipe for eventual disaster.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having one client represent the majority of your income is a truly dangerous position for any freelancer. But it\u2019s all too easy to let this happen to you. A client comes along that is a perfect match for your skills; they love your work and as their business grows, you gradually devote more and more of your time to them. You start feeling ultra comfortable with this relationship and its long-term potential. You slack off on your new business activities as your dance card fills up with this client\u2019s projects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then one day you get the bad news. In the case of one of my close colleagues, this news was that the privately owned construction company that had been monopolizing her time for four or five years had been sold. Her public relations and marketing services would no longer be required since the much bigger company that purchased her client\u2019s business already had several PR agencies on retainer. This scenario is far from the only reason you might lose your biggest client. The possibilities are endless and in many cases, they have nothing to do with the quality or value of work you\u2019re delivering.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Warning signs<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Often we\u2019re taken completely by surprise when a major client decides to stop using our services. Other times, red flags have been flying but we\u2019ve just chosen to ignore them because the status quo feels so comfortable. You may think something along the lines of: \u201cI\u2019ve been working with this company for years; I\u2019m part of the family.\u201d Wrong!<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are just a few signs of impending trouble that you can\u2019t afford to ignore:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>A change in payment patterns:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Is a client who has always paid on time now suddenly running a week or two (or even a month) late? If this happens just once, it\u2019s probably not an issue and there is usually a good explanation. But if this now becomes the \u201cnew normal,\u201d it is probably a sign that your client is in financial trouble and you may soon not have this client any more.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The client starts to beef up in-house staff: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many growing companies may eventually decide they want to bring the services you provide in-house so they have more control. If you see signs that your client is looking to hire people who do what you do, this is a clear warning sign that the work from this client is about to dry up.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>The new department head is hired: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a new leader comes from the outside to take over the department you work for, this could spell trouble. Often new folks already have a stable of vendors they like to work with and so they clean house and bring in the freelancers they\u2019ve worked with before. They\u2019re in and you\u2019re out.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><b>The best strategy <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avoid the too-many-eggs-in-one basket danger by never falling into this trap to begin with. Yes, many freelancers do start their businesses with just one major client, but the smart ones quickly start to build up their client roster so their destiny is not reliant on just one client. This means engaging in networking and other activities that will get your name and availability out there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you do have a nice roster of clients, don\u2019t let your guard down, however. Always make it a practice to know what percentage of your income is coming from each client. Personally, I start getting nervous if 40% of my revenue is coming from one client. I figure that is an amount of income I could survive without during the several months it might take to hustle up replacement business if that client disappeared. Yes, I might have to dip into my rainy day account, but I would survive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That 40% is not a magical number, but I think it would work for most folks. So if you find yourself inching towards 40% of your income coming from just one client, it\u2019s time to give serious thought to fixing this situation.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, of course you\u2019re thinking that you\u2019re already busy 100% of the time working for that big client and your smaller clients. How are you going to find time to start a new business initiative?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s the strategy I\u2019ve always used to solve this dilemma: Hire subcontractors to do some of the work on your plate so you have time for new business activities. I have frequently had two or three subcontractors working for me during really busy times and this works out well, especially if, like me, you want to grow revenues without taking on the responsibilities that come with hiring employees.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, realize that it is far easier to go out and attract new business when you\u2019re actually busy and feeling upbeat than it is when you\u2019re feeling defeated and possibly even desperate because you just lost your biggest source of income. When things are going well, you\u2019re less apt to make mistakes like underpricing work just to bring in some income.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a good look at where your income is coming from to see whether you\u2019re in danger of having too many eggs one basket. That\u2019s a situation that almost never ends well for a freelancer, so do whatever you can to avoid it. This will help you survive and thrive in your freelance life.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In nearly three decades of freelancing as a public relations consultant and ghostwriter, I\u2019ve listened all too often as clients and colleagues bemoaned the fact that<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":58,"featured_media":8101,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>The Danger of Putting Too Many Eggs in One Client Basket<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Often we\u2019re taken completely by surprise when a major client decides to stop using our services.
