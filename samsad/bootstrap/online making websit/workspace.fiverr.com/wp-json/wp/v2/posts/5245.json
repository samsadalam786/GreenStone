Here\u2019s what it means for freelancers and the world of work.<\/span><\/i><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Haven\u2019t heard of Mary Meeker?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">She\u2019s basically to the venture capitalist world what Sybill Trelawney is to divination (yes, I just likened a world-renowned securities analyst to a fictional fortune teller from <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Harry Potter<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">). <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Every year Meeker presents a report forecasting trends in the tech industry &#8211; and the world listens, because she\u2019s usually right. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In the past she\u2019s predicted things like the expansion of data-driven targeted user advertising (see her 2004 report) and the growth of a few pretty well-known companies, like Google, Amazon, Apple, Airbnb and Spotify. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">On Wednesday she presented <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HdjcdZqODoE&amp;feature=youtu.be\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">her annual presentation<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on the year\u2019s internet trends at the Code conference in California. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Her 30-minute, 294-slide presentation imparted loads of wisdom on everything from worldwide internet adoption and mobile usage, to hot topics like cryptocurrencies, voice technology and subscription services. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">An overarching theme was that the world of work continues to be disrupted by technology, at an ever-increasing pace. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For freelancers, there were four key shout outs. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Flexibility is a top priority for workers<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People\u2019s expectations for their careers are evolving, and these days their most desired non-monetary benefit is flexibility. This is fueling huge growth in the freelance space, with \u00a0freelance work growing three times faster than the growth of the total workforce. Part of this is also due to the fact that technology has made freelance and other forms of work easier to find &#8211; no matter where you are in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>On-demand workers are, well, in demand<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Technology has also made it easier for people to find work that fits with their schedules and supports the needs of the population more efficiently. Uber is the prime example, with 87% of drivers using Uber because they can set their own hours, and 85% of drivers using it for the work\/life balance it provides. The increasing desire for flexible scheduling has seen the on-demand workforce grow a huge 23% year-on-year. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Freelancers are lifelong learners<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The world of online education is growing, fueled by the availability of online courses and YouTube skill-sharing. In fact, 70% of YouTube\u2019s users look to the platform to help solve work, school, or hobby problems. And while lifelong learning is popular in many organisations, only 30% of non-freelancers have updated their skills in the past six months, whereas more than 50% of freelancers have. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Jobs will be stolen by freelancers, not robots<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">With highly-skilled workers now available to companies at the click of a button, it\u2019s not AI that regular workers need to be concerned about &#8211; it\u2019s freelancers who will replace them. And with all that upskilling they\u2019re doing, and their satisfaction with their flexible schedules at a high, it\u2019s not hard to see why. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Can\u2019t get enough of these sweet tech trends? <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can access the full slide deck below.<\/span><br \/>\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span> <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hotshot VC Mary Meeker gave her annual in-depth presentation about the digital landscape last Wednesday.
