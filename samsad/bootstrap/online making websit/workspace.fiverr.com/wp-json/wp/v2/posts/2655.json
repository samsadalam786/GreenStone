Recently, he was named to Forbes&#8217; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/30-under-30-2017\/marketing-advertising\/#6ce6abaf62bd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uber-exclusive roster<\/a> of the 30 best and brightest creatives and entrepreneurs under 30.\u00a0So, if you don\u2019t know, now you know.<br \/>\nWhat Forbes <em>doesn\u2019t<\/em> tell you about Shaun is how he has\u00a0achieved this level of success while working for himself and staying authentic to his brand. To kick off Hustle&amp;Co&#8217;s new series on the most inspiring and influential &#8220;hustlers&#8221; among us, we sat down with Shaun to better understand what makes him tick.<\/p>\n<h3>The influencer-creator thing\u2014everybody&#8217;s doing it.\u00a0How do you differentiate yourself?<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Attention is important, but the <em>right<\/em>\u00a0[kind of] attention is even more important,&#8221; says Shaun. &#8220;I try to do things differently by creating things people aren\u2019t usually expecting. I keep my ideas unique. My goal is to always share my story in a different way than most others are doing it.\u201d<br \/>\n<strong>Takeaway:<\/strong> When working on your personal brand, remain authentic and know your value as an individual. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/276337\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nielsen research<\/a> found that while just 15 percent of people trust what a brand says about itself, 90 percent will believe endorsement of a friend, peer or family member. In other words, no matter how differentiated you think you are, your work and your business relationships should ultimately speak for themselves.<\/p>\n<h3>What websites do you use for personal branding?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/shonduras.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Shonduras.com<\/a> is where I share my strengths and give an overview of how I create. I also try to stand out by making sure I have little pitch decks for unique campaigns I put together and share those often with potential clients.\u201d<br \/>\n<strong>Takeaway:<\/strong>\u00a0Many entrepreneurs and creatives are so focused on client work that they neglect their own personal brand. Storytelling as it pertains to your brand and your business is critically important, especially in hyper-crowded industries. Need some inspiration?\u00a0The Muse and SquareSpace <a href=\"https:\/\/www.themuse.com\/advice\/the-35-best-personal-websites-weve-ever-seen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently published<\/a> a piece highlighting 35 of the best personal branding sites they\u2019d ever seen. Each is unique and authentic\u2014have a look.<\/p>\n<h3>How do you use Twitter, Instagram and other social platforms to build your brand?<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;For me, Twitter is great for connecting with new people and opportunities. Instagram is more about showcasing my story and my content. YouTube is where I go hard to interact and create daily! Snapchat is also a tool I use often, as it&#8217;s super engaging and [allows me to collect]\u00a0instant feedback on content.&#8221;<br \/>\n<strong>Takeaway:<\/strong> When it comes to using social media for personal branding objectives, avoid falling into the trap of\u00a0auto updating across each of the major platforms. For each channel, consider that platform&#8217;s core strengths: Is it visual content? Is it real-time conversations and networking? Is it short-form video? Next, study your audience composition on each. A designer\u00a0might have similar follower counts on Twitter and Instagram for example, but Twitter might have more business networking potential, whereas Instagram might amass more peer followers.<\/p>\n<h3>How important has networking been to your success?<\/h3>\n<p>&#8220;Networking is huge,&#8221; says Shaun. &#8220;Most of my biggest opportunities have come from friends and people I met through networking. As they say it\u2019s not what you know, rather who you know &#8230; whoever &#8216;they&#8217; is.. [they]\u00a0are right.&#8221;<br \/>\nHe adds: &#8220;To find the right events, I look at how many people will be attending and how many days it will take away from my work flow. I always find reasons to make networking trips worthwhile.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Takeaway:<\/strong>\u00a0Networking works, but you must approach it wisely. Simply showing up at an event or conference is unlikely to yield ROI. You should always approach these events with a game-plan: Can you set up meetings in advance? Can you browse an attendee or speaker list beforehand?\u00a0Consider your goals and how you plan to achieve those through communications, in-person meetings, presentations on the ground and even collateral.<br \/>\n<em>This interview is part of <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\">Hustle&amp;Co<\/a>&#8216;s series, &#8220;The Hustlers,&#8221; which profiles inspirational, influential and up-and-coming independent talent.&lt;\/em?<br \/>\n<\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Shonduras is an internet sensation who was recently named to this year&#8217;s Forbes 30 Under 30 List.
