Just like the more traditional employee, you should still work to set up systems for money management and freelance accounting, respective of an irregular cash flow.<br \/>\nHere\u2019s what we recommend:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#1 Incorporate Your Business<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>My first year in business, I acted essentially as a sole proprietor, which is what <em>you<\/em> are also classified as if you haven\u2019t taken any steps to incorporate your business into an official entity. But the benefits of incorporating your business are numerous\u00a0and are necessary to set up finances when payment is irregular in your freelance business.<br \/>\nDid you know that incorporating your business:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduces taxes regarding income that passes through your business. Acting as a sole proprietor subjects you to self-employment tax on all earnings.<\/li>\n<li>Creates \u201cthe corporate veil\u201d which essentially separates business and personal assets. Translated for the uninitiated, this means that if your business gets sued, a disgruntled client can\u2019t go after your personal assets in a settlement.<\/li>\n<li>Allows you to apply for an EIN.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Talk to your accountant and lawyer to figure out what specific structure (LLC, S Corp, C Corp, etc.) is best for the type of freelance business you operate. Don\u2019t have these players in place just yet? Connect with your local small business association for free advice.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#2 Apply for an EIN<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>An EIN essentially acts as the social security number for your business. If you worry about privacy issues when submitting a W9 to a new client, using your business\u2019s name and EIN means you can keep your social security number to yourself.<br \/>\nApplying for an EIN is actually an incredibly simple and free process that likely won\u2019t require professional intervention. However, if you\u2019re working with a service to incorporate your business, they may include this step in the amount you\u2019re already paying them.<br \/>\nAt any rate, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online\">apply for an EIN<\/a> on the IRS website. Once you\u2019ve got that number in hand (you\u2019ll get access to it immediately after your application), you can then open a business bank account.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#3 Open Some Business Bank Accounts<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t already, you\u2019ll want to open a business checking and business savings account. Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll be using those for, and how they contribute to setting up finances when payment is irregular.<br \/>\nWhen you incorporate, you\u2019re essentially demonstrating that your business and personal finances are two distinct and separate entities. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier, this separation is necessary for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshbooks.com\/blog\/accounting-principles\">protecting personal assets<\/a> in the circumstance of a lawsuit.<br \/>\nTo make this distinction more clear, you\u2019ll want to open a second checking account in addition to whatever you\u2019re using for personal expenditures. This really needs to be a <em>business checking account<\/em>, to make it obvious as to which accounts suit what purposes.<br \/>\nBesides protecting your assets, opening a business bank account can be useful in understanding the <strong>true amount of money <\/strong>you have for personal expenses, and what you have for business expenses. Once established, make sure to re-route all income from clients (direct deposits, checks, etc.) to first land in this account.<br \/>\nFrom there, use your business account to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pay yourself<\/strong>: Estimate a twice-monthly salary and set up an automatic transfer.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pay your business bills<\/strong>: Ideally, you\u2019re also separating credit cards by use regarding business and personal purposes. Set an automatic payment to pay your business credit card from your business checking account.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Send money to your tax account<\/strong>: This should be automatic, and once or multiple times amount depending on your cash flow. Don\u2019t wait until the end of the year to pay taxes with the remainder of the balance available in your business checking account.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Open a Tax Savings Account<\/strong><br \/>\nI\u2019ll repeat &#8211; <strong>do not wait until the end of the year to set aside money for taxes<\/strong>.<br \/>\nDon\u2019t trick yourself and keep your business bank account balance artificially high, hoping that it ends up being enough without <em>truly knowing<\/em> what you owe. In your first year of business, you don\u2019t have to pay estimated taxes, and will instead send in a lump sum at the end of the fiscal year. Unfortunately, this can be more confusing than helpful to the new freelancer who hasn\u2019t quite figured out all of these important freelance accounting rules quite yet.<br \/>\nAs such, paying estimated quarterly taxes can actually be a bit of a relief, as they\u2019re unlikely to be off by much regarding the final total due at year\u2019s end (unless you\u2019re growing at an extremely rapid rate). Sending infrequent smaller payments, instead of one big payment, results in less of a stressor when it comes to parting with money.<br \/>\nDo yourself a favor and <em>overestimate<\/em> your contribution to taxes in your first year.<br \/>\nThis might mean saving anywhere between 20-33% of your income for taxes, depending on deductions and any tax breaks you\u2019ll eventually claim. Better to be safe than sorry, and if there\u2019s money left over in your tax account after paying last year\u2019s taxes in April, consider it as a head start on what you\u2019ll owe for the next year.<br \/>\nAlternatively, you might use any leftovers in your tax savings account as money to invest in retirement savings, which may also help to reduce your overall taxable income!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>#4 Set up Automatic Transfers<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The secret to freelance accounting is to automate the process as much as possible. In extremely high or low grossing months, dates and payment amounts may need to be adjusted. Regardless, having a structure in place reduces the amount of effort you\u2019ll need to put towards these tasks.<br \/>\nLet\u2019s take a look at the specific automatic transfers you\u2019ll want to set up, and how a monthly schedule of transfers might look respective of each piece.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Pay Yourself<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>First, pay yourself like you would if you were in the corporate world. Give yourself a twice-monthly salary, based on your estimated personal spending. This will help you to avoid spending what looks like \u201cextra\u201d money hanging out in your business checking account, instead saving it for emergencies and other unexpected expenses. Keeping money \u201cin the business\u201d can also help reduce your personal income tax contributions, but you\u2019ll want to talk to an accountant to figure out how to make this tactic work for you.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Save Your Money<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>From here, you\u2019ll want to set up additional automatic transfers &#8211; to your retirement accounts, to savings, and other budget goals (like a vacation) or long-term responsibilities (mortgage, car payment, etc.) you have.<br \/>\nTo give an example, once a month after an automatic transfer from my business checking account to my personal checking account, I transfer a portion of that total into a joint account that my boyfriend and I use for groceries, utilities, and other common expenses we share.<br \/>\nTiming is everything when it comes to setting up automatic investments, as you don\u2019t want to accidentally overdraw from an account before it\u2019s been funded from one of your other accounts!<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Plan for Taxes<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>As previously stated, set up an automatic transfer from your business checking account to a business savings account with the goal of using this account <em>only<\/em> for paying taxes.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Set and Forget Credit Card Payments<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>In order for this to work, you have to be a responsible credit card user, so that\u2019s the assumption I\u2019m making before giving this advice.<br \/>\nSet automatic payments from your business and personal checking accounts to your business and personal credit cards. Use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mint.com\">Mint<\/a> to monitor spending and any irregular charges.<br \/>\nBesides this oversight, don\u2019t trust yourself to always make payments on time. To avoid the ding that can end up really hurting your credit score, set up automatic payments on or before due dates.<br \/>\nSome credit cards have a set payment due date, but if you\u2019re trying to rock your freelance accounting when payment is irregular, try calling your credit card company, and ask for a new payment date that lines up with all of your other automatic transfers.<br \/>\nHere\u2019s what a sample timeline might look like for using automation to assist in freelance accounting:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>A Month in Automatic Transfers<\/strong><\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st<\/strong>: Transfer 1st paycheck of the month from business checking to personal checking<\/li>\n<li><strong>2nd<\/strong>: Transfer portion of \u201cpaycheck\u201d to joint checking and rent<\/li>\n<li><strong>7th<\/strong>: Transfer \u00bd of estimated tax payment from business checking to business savings<\/li>\n<li><strong>15th<\/strong>: Transfer 2nd paycheck of the month from business checking to personal checking<\/li>\n<li><strong>16th<\/strong>: Automatic payments for credit cards (business and personal)<\/li>\n<li><strong>16th<\/strong>: Transfer money to retirement\/savings accounts<\/li>\n<li><strong>22nd<\/strong>: Transfer \u00bd of estimated tax payment from business checking to business savings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You\u2019ll be amazed by how much of your freelance accounting gets taken care of without any need for intervention.<br \/>\nFor best results, before setting up a series of automatic transfers, give your business checking account a month or two to propagate with money, since it all flows down from there.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Freelance Accounting 101: How to Thrive When Payment is Irregular<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>For additional resources regarding freelance accounting and how to handle irregular payments, consider reading the following books:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Will-Teach-You-Be-Rich-ebook\/dp\/B004WL4BW6\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501181931&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+will+teach+you+to+be+rich\"><em>I Will Teach You to Be Rich<\/em><\/a> by Ramit Sethi (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com\/blog\/automating-money-for-small-business\/\">this article<\/a> of his expands on the concepts covered here)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Money-Book-Freelancers-Part-Timers-Self-Employed-ebook\/dp\/B0036S4D7O\/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501182063&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+money+book+for+freelancers\"><em>The Money Book for Freelancers, Part-Timers, and the Self-Employed<\/em><\/a> by Joseph D&#8217;Agnese and Denise Kiernan<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>How do you manage your own freelance accounting?
