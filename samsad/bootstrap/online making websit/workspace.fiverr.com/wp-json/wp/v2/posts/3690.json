But every so often, a bright and shiny opportunity comes knocking\u00a0at your door, that makes your heart stop and completely fall in love again with what you do<em>\u2014<\/em>and why you&#8217;re doing it.<br \/>\nWe spoke to 10 freelancers on which projects got their heart racing a bit faster than usual:<\/p>\n<h3>\u201cHello, Jerry\u201d<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cOne of my favorite projects would have to be working with Jerry Seinfeld to create the logo, branding and website for his show <a href=\"https:\/\/comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee<\/a>\u00a0which will soon be available on Netflix.

The only thing I had to do was file 1,000 words on my experience. I befriended a punk bartender and ate takoyaki in Osaka, stayed at the cutest little ryokans, took a ferry to an art-covered island in an inland sea, and walked around with semi-wild urban deer in a small town called Nara. It was a dream!&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ann Friedman is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.annfriedman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freelance journalist<\/a>, columnist for New York Magazine, and co-host of the podcast <a href=\"https:\/\/www.callyourgirlfriend.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Call Your Girlfriend<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Ciao ciao<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThe coolest gig I&#8217;ve done took place at Milan Design Week, an annual international exhibition for the furnishing and design industries. I spent one week advising top global brands about digital marketing, including social media and content marketing. I also ate a lot of great Italian food, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Josh Hoffman is the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epicfreelancing.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Epic Freelancing<\/a>, where he helps freelancers achieve financial success, creative freedom and lifestyle design.<\/p>\n<h3>Buckle up<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cSo far one of the coolest things I ever got to do was ride-along in the Breitling Jets in Houston and do a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/flying-high-and-upside-down-with-the-brietling-173617863.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">story<\/a> about it for Yahoo Autos. I also really loved doing the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/bp\/on-the-road-in-mercedes-sci-fi-self-driving-car-of-2030-154837903.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">story<\/a> about the fully autonomous Mercedes Benz of the future, a car called the F015.

One particularly eventful afternoon, the Daily News&#8217; court reporter had been tipped off that Danny Glover was at the courthouse for a meeting, so I arrived at the scene as the lone photog. As Glover exited the building, I said &#8216;Hey Danny&#8217; and maneuvered to get a clear shot of him. Not wanting to be photographed, he clocked me in the face. My first reputation as a photog was &#8216;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.nydailynews.com\/entertainment\/gossip\/glover-glowers-hits-news-photog-article-1.218317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the guy who got punched by Danny Glover<\/a>.&#8217; These days, I am the guy with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation-now\/2016\/12\/20\/santa-and-border-fence-photogs-holiday-series-turns-somber-2016\/95633156\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">crazy Christmas cards<\/a>.&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.garyhe.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gary He<\/a> is a photographer based in New York City and the Director of Operations and principal photographer of <a href=\"https:\/\/insiderimages.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Insider Images<\/a>.

Case in point: Cartoon Network&#8217;s \u2018Regular Show\u2019 was never quite as popular as its early time slot companion \u2018Adventure Time,\u2019 but I got to write about it a few times over the course of its run. So, when the show ended earlier this month, I got to moderate a panel at a screening of the series finale with members of the series&#8217; cast and crew. It was a really incredible and sort of emotional experience. If only I could tell my freshman year of college self that pretending to be an authority on cartoons would work out better than he could have possibly imagined.\u201d<br \/>\nEric Thurm is a freelance writer and the creator of Drunk TED Talks, an event series in New York and launching soon in Chicago.

Some of the coolest gigs I&#8217;ve had over the years include ghostwriting a novel, editing website copy for e-learning materials, facilitating workshops on social media management for small business owners, and conducting media relations for a local event.

It was such an interesting challenge because if you think about it, most big brands have sports and entertainment strategies, but don&#8217;t really have a set approach music, which is arguably a more important (and less crowded) connection point than both of those. So like, how does Charlie and the Chocolate Factory approach Coachella? I&#8217;m a club rat and a fat kid at heart (&#8230;and stomach), so you can imagine how much fun it was to work on.&#8221;<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/hellomagicmike.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">&#8216;Magic&#8217; Mike Jacobson<\/a> is an Grand Effie-winning brand strategy consultant who moonlights as a professional magician.<br \/>\n<em><strong>What was your most memorable gig?
