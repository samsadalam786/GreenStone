Taking vacations can be a challenge, your income tends to be more erratic, and\u2014oh, yeah\u2014there\u2019s also no employer matching for your retirement plan.<br \/>\nThese factors can make it all too easy to completely neglect saving for retirement altogether. But, unless you\u2019re part of the small percentage of freelancers who plan to work until they drop dead, you\u2019re going to need a decent nest egg to rely on when you reach that stage of life when you want to do nothing but golf, travel, and eat dinner at 4 p.m..<br \/>\nSo, what do you need to know to proactively and effectively save for retirement when you\u2019re living the freelance life? We\u2019ve got the lowdown on some best practices.<\/p>\n<h3>Start now (yes, now!)<\/h3>\n<p>With the income rollercoaster ride that\u2019s notorious with freelancing, it\u2019s easy to push your retirement savings to the backburner. However, that\u2019s a dangerous trap.<br \/>\nAbout <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/money\/4258451\/retirement-savings-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">75 percent of Americans<\/a> over age 40 are behind on saving for retirement, and that\u2019s not a club you should be eager to join. So, it\u2019s important that you make your retirement savings a priority now (yes, right now!).<br \/>\n\u201cYou want to eat when you\u2019re old, right?\u201d says Jonathan Medows, CPA and Founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cpaforfreelancers.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CPA For Freelancers<\/a>, \u201cYou\u2019re going to need that money when you\u2019re older, and that time sneaks up quicker than you think.\u201d<br \/>\nYes, your retirement might seem like a way distant point on the horizon. But, to rely on an old clich\u00e9, life is short. The sooner you can start saving, the better!<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fplanning-for-the-future-what-freelancers-should-know-about-saving-for-retirement%2F&#038;text=The%20sooner%20you%20can%20start%20saving%2C%20the%20better%21&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The sooner you can start saving, the better! <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fplanning-for-the-future-what-freelancers-should-know-about-saving-for-retirement%2F&#038;text=The%20sooner%20you%20can%20start%20saving%2C%20the%20better%21&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Know your options Now comes another big question: How do you go about saving for retirement?<\/h3>\n<p>\u201cThere are numerous different types of plans self-employed individuals can open,\u201d explains Noa Rodriguez-Hoffman, CFP and Founder of Socialyte Capital, a financial planning firm focused on digital influencers.<br \/>\nHere are a few different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/blog\/investing\/retirement-plans-self-employed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">retirement plan options<\/a> you can consider:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEP IRA<\/li>\n<li>Traditional or Roth IRA<\/li>\n<li>Solo 401(k)<\/li>\n<li>SIMPLE IRA<\/li>\n<li>Defined Benefit Plan<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These various plans have different pros, cons, requirements, and contribution limits. So, do your research (or sit down with an expert!) to choose the one that best suits your needs and your retirement goals.<\/p>\n<h3>Plan ahead<\/h3>\n<p>Because of the erratic cash flow that comes along with freelancing for a living, adequate budgeting and planning is essential for not only ensuring you can keep your lights on\u2014but also that you\u2019ll be able to tuck some pennies away for retirement.<br \/>\n\u201cCareful budgeting is extremely important for those who are self-employed,\u201d Rodriguez-Hoffman shares, \u201cBe sure to spend time forecasting not only how much you\u2019ll earn, but also when you will receive the income.\u201d<br \/>\nRodriguez-Hoffman recommends sitting down to create a month-by-month projection that nets out expected expenses against expected income. That will help you identify any gaps, keep cash flow in reserves to cover slow months, and also figure out a realistic amount to contribute to your retirement account.<br \/>\nAs far as how much you should be aiming to contribute? The more, the better. But, many financial experts recommend that you save at least <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/money\/collection-post\/2791164\/how-much-income-to-save-for-retirement\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 to 15 percent of your income<\/a> for retirement, starting in your twenties.<\/p>\n<h3>Set monthly targets<\/h3>\n<p>Saving for retirement can feel completely overwhelming. You need such a massive amount of money for a goal that still feels so far off, and that can be discouraging at best. You\u2019d rather spend that chunk of change on something you can benefit from right now, rather than ensuring that you can enjoy that early bird special 40 years from now.<br \/>\nThis is why it\u2019s better if you can break that big retirement goal down into smaller, more manageable pieces.<br \/>\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier if you try to do things monthly or quarterly,\u201d Medows explains, \u201cHave monthly or quarterly goals for what you should save. Breaking it down into smaller milestones will help keep you focused.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve taken care of your budgeting and forecasting (see how helpful that above step was?), you can take a look at how much you should plan to set aside each month or quarter.<br \/>\nEven if you can\u2019t move that money directly into your retirement account immediately (oftentimes those contributions are made during tax time!), you can set it aside in a separate savings account for now. That way, you know you have it!<\/p>\n<h3>Ask for help<\/h3>\n<p>No matter how much research you do or how much information you get under your belt, saving for retirement can still feel challenging\u2014particularly for those of us who don\u2019t consider ourselves \u201cnumbers people.\u201d<br \/>\nBut, never underestimate the value of reaching out for some help. \u201cAsk parents, grandparents, friends, or call up the bigger investment companies to get recommendations from them,\u201d suggests Medows.<\/p>\n<p>And, of course, if you feel like you could benefit from having a true expert in your corner, get connected with a CPA or CFP who can help you make decisions about how to save for your retirement.<br \/>\nRather than sitting down with the first person you find, do some digging to identify someone who would be the best match for you and your financial goals. \u201cIf you\u2019re not conservative, having someone who is conservative investing for you might not be the best fit,\u201d Medows adds.<\/p>\n<h3>Wrapping up<\/h3>\n<p>Saving for retirement is one of those things that\u2019s far too easy to push to the backburner\u2014particularly when you\u2019re trying to make ends meet as a freelancer. However, you definitely don\u2019t want to end up in the same camp as that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2015\/04\/28\/the-freelancers-guide-to-saving-for-retirement.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">45 percent of Americans<\/a> who don\u2019t have any retirement savings at all (yikes, right?).<br \/>\nSo, use these tips to map out a plan for yourself and start saving right now. Even if you don\u2019t have the financial flexibility to dump heaps of cash into your retirement account, every little bit helps! And, the sooner you start, the better off you\u2019ll be.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Got any retirement tips for freelancers?
