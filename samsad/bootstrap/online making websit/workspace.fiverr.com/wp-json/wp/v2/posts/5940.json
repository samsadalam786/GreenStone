The life of a freelancer is <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-time-tracking-can-make-you-a-more-productive-freelancer\/\">filled with productivity<\/a> challenges. It\u2019s the unfortunate cost of our freedom.<\/p>\n<p>We can do whatever we like, whenever we like, which is wonderful&#8230; but it makes getting the things we actually need to get done difficult some days. Thankfully, there are a number of useful productivity tools hiding in the browser many of us use every day.<\/p>\n<p>The following list details some of the best Chrome extensions I\u2019ve found for limiting distractions, keeping tabs on all of your communications, and getting more done in your work time.<\/p>\n<p>And installation is a breeze\u2014when you find one you like you can start using it almost immediately.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Create a distraction-free zone with Focus<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Focus-1.jpg\" alt=\"Focus - chrome extensions for productivity\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Focus allows you to block distracting websites for a period of time to help you focus on your work. It\u2019s a minimalist implementation of the Pomodoro Technique. Give Focus a list of the sites you tend to frequent when you\u2019re procrastinating and then start the timer. For 25 minutes your distractions will be blocked and unreachable. Focus also lets you organize your to-dos so that you can get the most out of your focus period.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Get Focus here<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gentle productivity reminders with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/timewarp\/mmmhadpnjmokjbmgamifipkjddhlfkhi\/details\">Timewarp<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>If you find working under a Pomodoro timer itself a distraction, Timewarp offers another way to rid yourself of distracting web destinations. Use their simple interface to set up what they call \u201cWormholes\u201d. You can configure these to either redirect you to a more productive website of your choosing when you attempt to go a time-sucking site like Facebook or Youtube, pop up a motivational message instead of the offending site, or simply time how long you spend there so that you can guilt yourself about it later.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/timewarp\/mmmhadpnjmokjbmgamifipkjddhlfkhi\/details\">Get Timewarp here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Easily track time with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/and-co\/cllajfedflpkeplbcojolihhlmmafmbb\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/apps\/desktop-app?utm_source=andcoblog\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Chrome-Extensions-for-Productivity-AND-CO-1.png\" alt=\"Chrome Extensions for Productivity - Fiverr Workspace\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>This <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/and-cos-free-time-tracking-desktop-app\/\">free extension<\/a>\u00a0makes it even quicker to track your time.

Block it out with one of the most elegant white noise generators we\u2019ve ever used. Using a simple click interface you can choose from a number of sounds like White Noise, Rain, Forest, Train, Fireplace and more. You can play multiple sounds simultaneously, like Rain and Train and then save that custom soundscape for later playback. Right from the extension, you can choose your saved combo \u201cRainy Night Express\u201d and play it indefinitely or on a timer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/noisli\/klejemegaoblahjdpcajmpcnjjmkmkkf?hl=en-US\">Get Noisli here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Create a task portal with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/taco\/aogabobfbepcehdkbfagdflinolncebh?hl=en\">Taco<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5944\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Taco-Chrome-Extension-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Depending on what you do for a living, you might interface with a number of services each day. Keeping tabs on all the tasks generated inside these applications can be challenging. Taco collects these from 40+ existing services as diverse as Bitbucket, Evernote, GitHub, Pocket, Slack and Trello and displays them all together in a Chrome tab. You can prioritize tasks across every service you use and act on them without having to open each application separately.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/taco\/aogabobfbepcehdkbfagdflinolncebh?hl=en\">Get Taco here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Minimalist notes extension with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/papier\/hhjeaokafplhjoogdemakihhdhffacia\">Papier<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes there\u2019s nothing better than that blank piece of paper and pen just within arm\u2019s reach for jotting down a quick idea or note.

After installing the extension all you need to do is open a new tab and you have a notepad. You can type directly onto the browser window and anything you type is immediately saved. You\u2019ll see all your previous notes together on one page.

Not to mention the level of distraction that it adds when you accidentally click into the wrong tab. Well no more! With a click of the OneTab button all your open tabs will be compiled as links in a list occupying a sum total of one tab (hence the name). Need to reopen a page? Just click on its link in OneTab and the page pops back up as a new tab. OneTab says it saves 95% of your RAM compared with leaving all your tabs open. And I&#8217;d say it saves 30% worth of brainpower having a clean and clear browser.*<\/p>\n<p>*Yeah, I picked a random number&#8230; But it does feel good.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/onetab\/chphlpgkkbolifaimnlloiipkdnihall\">Get OneTab here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Gmail interface extension with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/checker-plus-for-gmail\/oeopbcgkkoapgobdbedcemjljbihmemj?hl=en-US\">Checker Plus<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a good chance as a freelancer you have multiple email accounts and an even better chance that you get a lot of email in all of these.

Boomerang makes sure your message arrives right when you think it\u2019s most likely your client is sitting in front of their computer, which increases the chances of a speedy response. But in case they don\u2019t get back to you, Boomerang also allows you to reminders to follow up with that person if Boomerang sense you don\u2019t receive a response.

Productivity Owl\u2019s unique approach to limiting distracting web surfing involves setting a timer on every page you visit. Each time you open a tab you\u2019ll see the Productivity Owl sitting down in the bottom corner of the page counting down the amount of time you\u2019re allowed to spend there. When the timer runs out the owl closes the page for you. Not only does this limit distracting sites it also disciplines you to get what you need from legitimate sites as quickly as possible. And we can all use a little more discipline. Of course, you have the ability to white list any sites that you need to stay open permanently.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/productivity-owl\/eoagmdboiealblmpaahjlhajggndaahi\">Get Productivity Owl here<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Stay precise even when you&#8217;re rushed with <a href=\"https:\/\/chrome.google.com\/webstore\/detail\/grammarly-for-chrome\/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen\">Grammarly<\/a><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5945\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Grammarly-1.jpg\" alt=\"Grammarly - chrome extension\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" \/><\/p>\n<p class=\"C-b-p-j-Oa C-b-p-j-Oa-ArRF3d-mb\">Don&#8217;t waste time proofreading that email for the third time.
