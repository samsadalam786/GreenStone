Sometimes, no matter what you do, projects are hard to come by and business is low. Does that mean you can\u2019t enjoy the finer things? No! You\u2019re a freelancer so you\u2019ll just have to get creative. To spark your imagination, here\u2019s a list of things to do when you need a pep-in-your-step that your wallet can\u2019t provide.<\/p>\n<h1>Panera is Your Friend<\/h1>\n<p>The stereotype is right: freelancers love to work out of coffee shops. There\u2019s caffeine, Wi-Fi, and the smallest chance for a human interaction when an overly trusting person asks you to watch their computer (that last one is a double-edge sword). But when you\u2019re low on funds, coffee can add up. Time to let go of your hipster brew and head to a chain restaurant like Panera. Panera has free refills and most establishments don\u2019t care if you stay for ten hours or more. Seriously, hole yourself up in there. Trust me on this because I\u2019ve done it. So stock up on that free java because there won\u2019t be anyone judging.<\/p>\n<h1>Give Your Jeans Another Wear<\/h1>\n<p>As Levi\u2019s CEO Chip Bergh said, &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/life-style\/fashion\/levis-ceo-explains-why-you-should-never-wash-your-jeans-a6881031.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DON\u2019T WASH YOUR JEANS<\/a>!&#8221; When I heard that advice, I thought, \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s gross!\u201d but now I think, \u201cwhoa, that\u2019s not as gross that I used to think it was!\u201d Washing them less can save you time and money. I used to wash my jeans after almost every wear, LIKE A MODERN-DAY FOOL. But now, I\u2019d rather have that sweet cash in my jean pocket, no matter how dirty it is.<\/p>\n<h1>Learn To Cook!<\/h1>\n<p>Always being on the hustle can keep us out of the kitchen. But when money is tight, cooking is a\u00a0fun way to keep cost down. Freelancers like to create, right? So why not create and get the added bonus of feeding yourself at the same time. And hey, no need to become a master chef in a day. This isn\u2019t the 2009 Streep\/Adams\/Tucci dramedy <em>Julie &amp; Julia<\/em>. You can do wonders with cans of tuna fish or a cheap Crockpot. Forgo that Seamless app &amp; open up Pinterest. You\u2019ll be amazed what you can make for less.<\/p>\n<h1>Stop &amp; Listen to Street Performers<\/h1>\n<p>Just because you can\u2019t afford a concert ticket doesn\u2019t mean there aren\u2019t live entertainers for you to see. Street performers want strangers to stop and enjoy their art. It may not be your thing, but having an emptier wallet makes you appreciate the world around you. On a nice day, it definitely beats spending $60 for the cheap seats in an arena where a bottle of water costs $8. Or, if you do have a buck to spare, why not share the wealth with a street performer? They are essentially freelancers just like you.<\/p>\n<h1>Settle-in &amp; Binge<\/h1>\n<p>Date night &amp; a movie? Not so much when you&#8217;re counting pennies. Seeing a film in theaters is now a special experience due to the price. Don\u2019t even talk about getting a bucket of popcorn and a soda. You\u2019ll need to take out a loan. Monthly subscription services cost less than a movie ticket and you can watch as much as you want. Have you seen <em>Stranger Things<\/em> on Netflix? It\u2019s legitimately unbelievable. Who do you love more, Niles Crane, Frasier Crane, or Eddie? If you can\u2019t answer that question seriously, than it\u2019s time to get binging. <em>Mean Girls<\/em> is streaming right now and who doesn\u2019t miss an up-and-coming Lohan? So while we need to support films at the box office, give your piggy bank a break and find your favorite spot on the couch. It\u2019s time to stream, baby.<\/p>\n<h1>Take A Walk<\/h1>\n<p>Needs no explanation but I will add this one caveat, keep your phone in your pocket and look up.<br \/>\nThere\u2019s a lot of ways to stretch a dollar when you need to without feeling like you\u2019re missing out. Creating frugal ways for you to experience life will help you consistently throughout this journey to build your business. Work is only one part of life and there\u2019s so much out there to take in!<br \/>\nP.S. My favorite <em>Frasier <\/em>character is Niles Crane. Happy to talk to you extensively about why \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Freelancers are some of the hardest working people around, but even the hardest worker experiences times of low income.
