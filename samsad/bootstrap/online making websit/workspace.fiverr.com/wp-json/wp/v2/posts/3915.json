It&#8217;s nice to have your own following and a pretty Twitter banner, but there is indeed a strategy behind higher rates and landing bigger clients. From maintaining strong social profiles to building a credible online portfolio, here&#8217;s what you should do\u00a0before raising your freelance rates.<\/p>\n<h3>Documented experience in your niche<\/h3>\n<p>There are a lot of talented people who have great experience but can\u2019t speak to that experience. Being able to tell the narrative of your professional history is a big asset. Many times you aren\u2019t fortunate enough to have this conversation, so your online identity needs to get this story across.<br \/>\nDocumenting experience in your industry can show in a variety of ways: a strong professional summary, a story of data quantifying your value, or even brand logos that recognize top-tier clientele.<br \/>\nAlways take the time to think about your past experiences and how to characterize that value in a way that can be quickly understood.<\/p>\n<h3>There&#8217;s power in social media<\/h3>\n<p>Most would think this is a no-brainer, but it&#8217;s importance to have a strong presence across the appropriate channels. Many freelancers will only put effort into Twitter while neglecting to create a substantial LinkedIn page.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F4-must-haves-raising-freelance-rates%2F&#038;text=The%20days%20of%20having%20a%20credible%20presence%20in%20only%20one%20location%20online%20are%20far%20gone&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The days of having a credible presence in only one location online are far gone <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F4-must-haves-raising-freelance-rates%2F&#038;text=The%20days%20of%20having%20a%20credible%20presence%20in%20only%20one%20location%20online%20are%20far%20gone&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nThe days of having a credible presence in only one location online are far gone, all of your profiles should represent your brand.<br \/>\nEmployers are looking for skilled individuals, but the added bonus comes with bringing along your own audience.

Whether your references are shown through LinkedIn recommendations or the more traditional PDF call sheet, they still matter.<br \/>\nA reference from past projects, co-workers, or upper management can go a long way when it comes to securing future roles.
