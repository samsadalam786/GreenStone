If you&#8217;re not careful, it can make you feel like the tax collector in <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/disney-robin-hood-H0uLRCd8JIhRS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Disney\u2019s <em>Robin Hood<\/em><\/a>, stealing the last coin from an adorable little church mouse. But when you\u2019ve done 38 hours of work for a client who\u2019s suddenly MIA, you\u2019re forced to turn rogue and unleash your inner bounty hunter. Here are some unusual personalities that might take over while you&#8217;re tracking down those paychecks! Which one are you?<\/p>\n<h2>Polite with a capital P<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s really hard to switch from being an amicable freelancer to a stern cash collector, especially if you\u2019re a freelancer who signs their emails with \u2018Best wishes\u2019. In an attempt to not burden the client, the &#8216;polite&#8217; freelancer will allow\u00a0late payments to become VERY late payments! They&#8217;ll even start apologizing to the client for sending them an invoice\u00a0in the first place!\u00a0To all of you polite freelancers out there, be careful,\u00a0if you wait too long it\u2019ll be the new tax year by the time you see that dough!<\/p>\n<h2>The Panicker<\/h2>\n<p>We all panic sometimes, but it\u2019s important to keep a level head when dealing with money. <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/panic-stressed-1FMaabePDEfgk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Panicker<\/a> will send frantic emails at 2am, riddled with spelling errors and long-winded sentences about not being able to pay their pet insurance on time. They\u2019ve also been known to pace wildly around their home office, leaving numerous voicemails on a client\u2019s answering machine and\u00a0screaming\u00a0\u2018invoice\u2019 every 3 words.<br \/>\nThis is never a good look or a healthy one. Calm down and have a cupcake. You deserve it.<\/p>\n<h2>The Enforcer<\/h2>\n<p>If a client ignores the first invoice you\u00a0send them, it only seems\u00a0fair to send a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paypal<\/a> request as a gentle reminder. But for The Enforcer, it doesn&#8217;t\u00a0stop at Paypal. A quick <a href=\"https:\/\/venmo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Venmo<\/a> request is sent swiftly after the Paypal one, followed by a <a href=\"https:\/\/venmo.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bank of America<\/a>\u00a0transfer request. Your client can\u2019t possibly ignore your cries\u00a0after 12 separate requests are sent from 6 different financial institutions, right? Or could they?<\/p>\n<h2>The Lawyer<\/h2>\n<p>When a payment is late the only reasonable thing to do is break out a highlighter and send over your contract stating when and how you need to be paid. You might even Google a few employee rights from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dol.gov\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Department of Labor<\/a> and copy\/paste\u00a0them into the email as well. Who knows, if the client still doesn\u2019t pay up, you have a community of freelance lawyers you can call on, and you can break out\u00a0your best <a href=\"https:\/\/giphy.com\/gifs\/film-julia-roberts-erin-brockovich-DmQ0IMNX34uiY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Erin Brockovich<\/a> impersonation! Score!<\/p>\n<h2>The CO<\/h2>\n<p>Enjoying your weekend? Of course you are. You\u2019re not worrying about chasing money because your personal <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/freelance-life-before-and-after-having-an-and-co-chief-operator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chief Operator at Fiverr Workspace<\/a> has your back.
