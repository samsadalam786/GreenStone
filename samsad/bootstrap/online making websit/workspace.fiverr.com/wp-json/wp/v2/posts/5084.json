After using it every day for three years now, I really do believe Medium is the easiest, most accessible site for drafting, editing, publishing, and sharing your writing online.<br \/>\nIn terms of your blogging topics, I feel like the best subjects for satisfy all three of the following categories:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Something you are passionate about<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Something that you have a unique perspective on<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Something that is useful for others<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Personally, I created my blog around sharing how to make your own ideas happen because:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I am extremely passionate about helping others create their own paths and pursue their own ideas<\/li>\n<li>I\u2019ve been freelancing\/pursuing my own ideas for my entire professional career (almost a decade)<\/li>\n<li>Throughout this time, I\u2019ve met countless individuals who are struggling with common issues (how to position their idea, how to remove yourself as a roadblock, etc.) and they fall into three categories: 1) students, 2) independent creatives, and 3) people who work in corporate settings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Admittedly, this may take more introspection on your part to find out what satisfies these three areas. Once you do, it will motivate you to blog consistently, which is, by far, the most important thing for growing an audience.<br \/>\nHere is the process I\u2019ve used in order to grow an audience on Medium:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write every day for at least 30 minutes and publish 2\u20133 times a week on The Imperfectionist.<\/li>\n<li>Set up a newsletter using <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/upscri.be\/\">Upscribe<\/a>, a service that allows you to crate embeddable email capture forms. Include a form at the end of each article.<\/li>\n<li>I use my weekly newsletter to provide value through tidbits of advice for making ideas happen while also sharing early content from my book (outlines, sections, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Continue building this community for the release of future products and services (an engaged audience is always better when it comes to offering products).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t forget: creating and sustaining a high-quality blog is a long-term commitment.<\/strong><br \/>\nHopefully this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions about Medium or blogging in general. Cheers and good luck!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Three years ago, I decided to start writing (almost) every day on Medium and it was one of the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.
