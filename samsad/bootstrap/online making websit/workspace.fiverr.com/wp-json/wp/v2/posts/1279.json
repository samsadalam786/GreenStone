But, if you\u2019re willing to do some digging, you might just find some gems! <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tips for Effectively Using Freelance Job Board Sites<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, finding the jobs that interest you is a great first step. But, as you likely already know, that\u2019s really only half the battle. With so much competition out there (not to mention so many scams!), it can be tough to actually experience great results from using sites that so many freelancers flock to.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, what can you do help ensure you have a good experience? These three key tips are a great place to start. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1. Research, Research, Research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you find a freelance job that interests you, take a few minutes to do some research about the company. Poke around their website and social media accounts to get a better feel for their vibe. Dig up some reviews to see what other people are saying. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this won\u2019t reveal everything, it\u2019ll definitely give you a better sense of whether or not this opportunity is legitimate, as well as if you and the company would be a good match to work together!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. Stand Out From the Crowd<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s face it\u2014these sites make searching for freelance gigs much easier and more convenient, which also means there\u2019s usually an abundance of competition applying for the very same projects. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you\u2019re going to need to find some ways you can stand out and separate yourself from the freelance pack. Maybe that means emphasizing a certain skillset or piece of experience that very few people possess. Or, perhaps it means completing an amazing sample project. The bottom line is this: Figure out what you can do to be memorable. That\u2019s important. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. Follow Up<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019ve ever utilized a job board, you know it can often feel like you\u2019re submitting your materials into the great, big internet black hole. It\u2019s for this very reason that following up on the opportunities you\u2019re interested in is so important. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can find someone to contact personally, that\u2019s always best. But, never hesitate to use a general \u201cjobs@company.com\u201d or \u201cinfo@company.com\u201d email address. Any effort to follow up adequately emphasizes your level of interest and engagement in the position. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you feel ready to roll up your sleeves and get your freelance business moving, not having any projects to work on can be frustrating\u2014and finding freelance work can often present a challenge. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a deep breath and unclench your fists\u2014there\u2019s no need to be disheartened yet. Instead, turn your attention to these different websites and prepare to fill up your schedule with awesome projects! <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your freelance website is polished up and ready to promote you, your workspace is organized, and you\u2019re ready and raring to tackle some awesome projects.
