In the age of Uber and the Great Recession, the scale of the freelance community continues to grow year over year, with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elainepofeldt\/2016\/10\/06\/new-survey-freelance-economy-shows-rapid-growth\/#2afff0ce7c3f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">over 35 percent<\/a>\u00a0of the U.S. workforce engaging in some sort of freelance work in 2016.<br \/>\nFor some, the side hustle is purely the means to an economic end. If you\u2019re one of the 46 percent of Americans who is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/ashleystahl\/2016\/07\/12\/underemployment\/#7e7bd3b866c9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">underemployed<\/a>, that second gig may be your only hope for chipping away at those student loans or indeed for making rent.<br \/>\nThe traditional Baby Boomer career trajectory, lined with comfortable pensions and the livable wages of neatly hedged 40-hour work weeks, is on the decline. Today\u2019s professional may seek security through diversifying and supplementing sources of income.<br \/>\nAmong those who find themselves on a career path they hadn\u2019t necessarily envisioned\u2014the intellectually underemployed\u2014a passion project that brings in some extra dollars helps feed the soul and makes the monotony of the 9-to-5 less likely to result in arson.<br \/>\nTo all the part-time-preneurs, bloggers, Sunday picklers, and pre-dawn yoga instructors out there, behold the Hustle&amp;Co. guide\u00a0for balancing a full-time job with a side hustle\u2014from someone who\u2019s doin\u2019 it rn.<\/p>\n<h3>Is it worth it? Let me work it.<\/h3>\n<p>Before diving in, make sure that honey pot is sweet enough to justify committing a good chunk of your otherwise \u201cfree time\u201d to your side gig.<br \/>\nBear in mind, of course, that there are plenty of ways to measure its worth, and it\u2019s important to cultivate a clear understanding of your personal objectives for a given project. It might pay handsomely, build your experience in a new skill or discipline you hope to break into full time, satisfy your passions, or simply finance your creative but costly hobby.<br \/>\nWhatever the objective, make sure the gig\u2019s incentives are well aligned.<\/p>\n<h3>Make time\u2014don\u2019t find it.<\/h3>\n<p>With competing responsibilities, it won\u2019t always be easy to get everything done. When you have a deadline or a dollar amount you need to hit, carve out your designated work time in advance.<br \/>\nWhile that advice falls under the \u201cwater is wet\u201d category on one front, it will also help you maintain some healthy boundaries and avoid disruptions to your personal life, in turn making your side hustle more sustainable.<br \/>\nPlus, if you proactively allocate your work hours, you\u2019ll use them more efficiently and be less prone to dawdling in Instagram rabbit holes, procrastinatory zit popping sessions, and other distractions that can turn a two-hour project into a five-hour blotchy, FOMO\u2019d out mess.<br \/>\nYou\u2019ll also come to understand the actual value of your time more clearly, which will help you set rates, goals, and expectations in future projects.<br \/>\nLastly, maintaining structure around your side gig will help stave off burnout and over-commitment once you calibrate how much work is realistically manageable for you.<\/p>\n<h3>&#8220;I\u2019ve made a huge mistake.&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p>Your razor sharp street smarts wouldn\u2019t let you fall for a Nigerian prince phone scam, and neither should they let you fall into any professional agreement with unsavory characters.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re counting on your side hustle for cash, take the time to vet collaborators and clients for transparency and accountability to the best of your ability. You don&#8217;t need to spend precious time chasing down deliverables and payments from flaky, disorganized, or <a href=\"https:\/\/media1.giphy.com\/media\/l0Ex1u8UxN0hf86IM\/giphy.gif\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dishonest associates<\/a>.<br \/>\nFinally, for your own sake and for that of anyone whose social media presence falls remotely within your sphere of influence, steer clear of side hustles that are, well, a hustle. Do not, for any reason, agree to sling tacky nail wraps, body wraps, or anything that requires an up-front \u201cstarter kit\u201d investment. These multi-level marketing schemes are far more likely to result in debt and strained friendships than financial freedom or entrepreneurial experience.
