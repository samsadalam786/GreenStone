And it\u2019s especially difficult when you\u2019re new and don\u2019t have an established list of clients. Many freelancers spend hours every day hammering out <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\/\">proposals<\/a> on a freelancing platform, knowing that many won\u2019t be accepted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the ability to bid on projects anywhere in the world, it\u2019s easy to ignore job opportunities right in our own backyard. But before freelancing platforms even existed, most people did business locally.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we\u2019ll look at how to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/saleshigher.com\/generate-b2b-leads\/\" target=\"_blank\">use local SEO to get sales leads<\/a> from businesses near where you live.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What\u2019s Local SEO?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Local Search Engine Optimization is the process of optimizing your website for local business. Imagine you move to Springfield and don\u2019t have a doctor yet. If you get sick you might search on Google for \u201c<strong>doctors office near me<\/strong>\u201d or \u201c<strong>medical clinic in Springfield<\/strong>.\u201d Google knows from those queries that you are looking for something nearby. But guess what?! If you just search for \u201c<strong>medical clinic<\/strong>\u201d Google will still show you mostly local results.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your business isn\u2019t \u2018brick and mortar\u2019 like a doctors office or hair salon, but you can still get lots of local traffic by doing the exact same things that local businesses do.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>But why bother?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, but isn\u2019t it easier to get business from the platforms?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancing platforms are great, but they aren\u2019t without potential problems. You are usually bidding against multiple people for the same job. And many of them work in countries with lower overheads, which can push down costs. You also run the risk of the platform changing its terms and conditions on short notice. The best solution to mitigate these risks is to put your eggs in different baskets. You can use freelancing platforms while working on getting local clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having local clients means far less competition and limited downward pressure on pricing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what it looks like when you are in the \u201clocal 3 pack\u201d for your service.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nice, right! Getting in the local 3 pack doesn\u2019t take a lot of work. Below are some steps to take.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Select Your Keyword and Location<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to do is decide what you\u2019d like to be known for. Some freelancers offer a variety of solutions. But you\u2019re better off choosing just one. This keeps your website focused, and makes it easy for Google (and humans) to understand what your site is about.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about how people search for your solution. If they are looking for a local service, they\u2019ll probably add a location modifier to their search.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common form of search will often yield the best opportunities. Using a bookkeeping example, which of these keywords has the most search volume?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>bookkeeping Miami<\/li><li>bookkeeping services Miami<\/li><li>bookkeeping agency Miami<\/li><li>bookkeeping company Miami<\/li><li>bookkeeping solutions Miami<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure which word works best, use a <a href=\"https:\/\/keywordseverywhere.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"keyword tool (opens in a new tab)\">keyword tool<\/a> and do some research. You want keywords that have good search volume, but aren\u2019t too competitive.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, \u201cbookkeeping Miami\u201d and \u201cbookkeeping services Miami\u201d have decent search volume and aren\u2019t very competitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, change your website\u2019s title to reflect your keyword. You can add your main keyword phrase into your site content and use it in your H1 tag.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Name &#8211; Address &#8211; Phone Number (NAP)<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a look at how your NAP is listed on your website. Is it consistent everywhere? Sometimes small details like \u201c<strong>Ltd<\/strong>\u201d or brackets in the phone number \u201c<strong>(123) 555-6789<\/strong>\u201d can confuse search engines. So make SURE you use your contact information the exact same as on your website when you register on other sites, like Google My Business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put your NAP on the footer of your website. This will ensure it\u2019s the same on every page. And you can associate the content on that page with your location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Register for Google My Business<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you register for Google My Business then you\u2019ll be on the map (literally &#8211; Google maps). And you\u2019ll have a good chance of being shown in the \u201clocal 3 pack.\u201d Which is a great way to get discovered by clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that Google My Business is free, it\u2019s a wonder that more businesses don\u2019t use it. But sadly, many companies don\u2019t make the effort. Depending on the size of your town or city you may find you\u2019re the only company in your niche to claim a Google My Business listing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you set up your listing Google will want to verify that you do business at the address you listed. There are a couple of ways to verify your address, but the easiest is for Google to mail you a PIN number to your physical location. When it arrives you can input it into your Google My Business profile to confirm your location.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Register in Local Directories<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Take an hour to register in some online directories. When you sign up, make sure you use the EXACT same contact details as on your website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t need to sign up for a huge number of directories. Four to six will establish your online presence. Try to focus on directories that are specific to your niche, or directories related to your geography. For example, a listing in the local chamber of commerce for your niche works very well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some larger directories to consider include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Yelp&nbsp;<\/li><li>HotFrog<\/li><li>YellowPages<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Get Reviews<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask your clients if they think you\u2019ve delivered \u20185 star\u2019 results. If they do, ask them to give you a local review on Google My Business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google gives a lot of weight to reviews. It\u2019s not a coincidence that the companies in the local 3 pack are often ones with the most positive reviews.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven\u2019t got a lot of local competition in your area then just a couple of strong reviews can give you a huge boost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviews are so powerful that some sales people in physical stores ask customers to pull out their phones and provide a star rating before they\u2019ll let them leave!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Get Some Backlinks<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The final thing to do is get some high quality backlinks to your website. It\u2019s not easy, but that\u2019s ok. If you have to work hard to get a few backlinks, then your competitors do, too. And you can out work them, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are TONS of ways to get backlinks, but the simplest way is to offer to write an article for established websites in your niche. In the article include a link to an article on your own website. And now you have a backlink to your website!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backlinks are the way Google will know you are important in your industry and worth ranking during searches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Huge ROI<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The local SEO steps listed above cost nothing and take little to no effort. That\u2019s what makes them so powerful. For a very small time investment you can find yourself consistently at the top of Google for your niche.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just as importantly, you\u2019ll eventually establish yourself as a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/blog\/local-seo-begins-with-community\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"leader in your niche in your community (opens in a new tab)\">leader in your niche in your community<\/a>. When you do that, other local opportunities will begin to open up to you, too.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Finding new clients as a freelancer takes effort.
