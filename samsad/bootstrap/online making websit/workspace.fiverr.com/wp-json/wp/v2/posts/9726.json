Do you dream about the day you can reclaim those hours and take back control of your schedule? Well, freelancing might be the revolution you&#8217;re after! The freelancer\u2019s schedule is an ever-changing beast, but unlike most jobs, freelancing allows you to roam a bit more,&nbsp;with a schedule that suits you. Check out these benefits to living a life-o-freelance!&nbsp;Wriggle out of those 9-5 handcuffs and reclaim the work day!<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers Beat The Traffic<\/h2>\n<p>Do you ever wonder why the other side of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sigalert.com\/?lat=34.1749&amp;lon=-118.615196&amp;z=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">freeway<\/a> always seems to be going faster? Do you ever think it would be nice to go <i>against <\/i>the traffic once in a while? Well, good news, with freelancing you can! Freelancers are able to work unconventional hours, which often means starting later in the morning and driving through empty, unclogged streets. Freelancing also means you can do a lot of work from home, where there&#8217;s zero traffic! That is, unless you\u2019re a messy person. In which case, you\u2019ll still have to battle through clothes and cereal boxes to get to your desk.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers Skip The Line<\/h2>\n<p>Are there long lines at your favorite coffee shop around 8:45am? Do you <i>always <\/i>get stuck behind the same intern who\u2019s trying to order 42 coffees from a list he wrote on his hand that&#8217;s now melting into a swirl&nbsp;of ink and sweat? Well, we&#8217;ve got good news: If you start freelancing, you can enjoy off-peak coffee trips every day! You might even be able to work from your local coffee shop and watch the morning&nbsp;rush from the comfort of a cozy window seat. Just don\u2019t get too smug &#8211; and make sure you hold the door for that poor intern.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers are in Errand Heaven<\/h2>\n<p>We all hate running errands, but is it the errands we hate, or the fact that we all do them at the same time? Are you fed up with heading to the post-office during the same hour that everyone else goes to send off their mail? Switch to a life of freelancing and run errands on <i>your<\/i> time. Freelancing means you can schedule your work around <i>your<\/i> day. You can pop into a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.riteaid.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rite Aid<\/a> at 3pm for some dish soap and be out before you can say #wellnesscard.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers are Early Birds &amp; Night Owls<\/h2>\n<p>The 9-5 work day isn\u2019t easy on either the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/kellyoakes\/are-you-an-early-bird-or-a-night-owl?utm_term=.waJwl5356#.wqZq6OmOv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">night owls or the early birds<\/a>. To all of my early birds: Do you wish you were able to start work earlier and&nbsp;finish by 2pm? If you freelance, you can wake up with the London markets and get to work when you decide! For those of you who are night owls, don\u2019t worry, most freelance work can be done remotely, and therefore at any hour, even 11pm when you\u2019re 6 coffees in and at your most productive. Fly free my night owls and early birds, fly free!<\/p>\n<h2>Freelancers Have Lunch Control<\/h2>\n<p>Sure, the <a href=\"https:\/\/roaminghunger.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">food truck<\/a> outside of your building has great BBQ, but what if you feel like eating something that requires cutlery once in a while? The 1 hour window you\u2019ve been graciously given for lunch isn\u2019t enough time to head to your favorite steakhouse. You\u2019d have to inhale your ribeye in under 20 minutes and run back to work before it\u2019s even hit your stomach. Freelancers get to choose when <i>they<\/i> want to go to lunch. After all, it\u2019s <i>your <\/i>lunch! You can even work on a few Excel pivot tables at your favorite lunch spot and have a constant flow of tasty treats sent out from the kitchen. Delicious.<\/p>\n<h2>For the Freelancer, It&#8217;s Quality Over Quantity<\/h2>\n<p>If it\u2019s a quiet day at work and you&#8217;ve got little to do, why not skip out early and enjoy the downtime? Oh, because you work a 9-5 and you\u2019re pretty much handcuffed to the desk between those hours. Freelancers only work when they need to, allowing them to enjoy the <a href=\"https:\/\/findgravy.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">finer things in life<\/a>. Now don\u2019t get us wrong, freelancing can call for long work days, sometimes going for&nbsp;12+ hours straight, but when there are slow days you can kick back and head to the beach! The best part is, you\u2019ll never have to sit at your desk pointlessly tweaking your email signature because you\u2019re \u2018required\u2019 to stay until 5pm. Shut down the computer and get&nbsp;living!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you reading this from the confines of your office cubicle, somewhere between the hours of 9am and 5pm (or 6pm, or 7pm, or, well, you<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":45,"featured_media":7706,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[16,17],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Reap the Benefits of a Freelance Schedule<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Check out these benefits to living a life-o-freelance!
