You have one W2, maybe a few write-offs, and that might be that.<br>As a freelancer, it\u2019s a whole new ball game. You may have dozens of clients\u2014which may mean <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/in-the-battle-of-1099-vs-w2-where-do-freelancers-fall\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dozens of 1099s<\/a>. You may also have a lot of travel and equipment expenses. You\u2019re getting paid via direct deposit here, via PayPal there, and via check or cash from someone else. There\u2019s a lot more to keep track of, and then, once you start earning enough <a href=\"https:\/\/selfemployment-taxcalculator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-employment<\/a>&nbsp;income, you may have to start filing quarterly.<br>It\u2019s hard to be an expert in your field and also an expert at managing your taxes. That\u2019s why we look to the professionals\u2014and many of them were kind enough to give us their advice in the six common mistakes listed below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #1: Not Knowing What You Can Write Off<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New Jersey-based accountant Tanner Shields of Wagner, Shields &amp; Jennings, PC, stressed the importance of <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/our-no-1-piece-of-advice-for-first-time-self-employed-taxpayers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">planning and consulting with a professional<\/a> before you even begin to organize your records.<br>\u201cBeing self-employed allows you to write off a ton of different expenses\u2014Expenses that you normally wouldn\u2019t be able to write off,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can deduct a portion of your cell phone bill, you can deduct your health insurance payments, get deductions for miles driven for business, even claim a certain percentage of your home office. A lot of self-employed people don\u2019t take full advantage of every deduction they\u2019re entitled to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sentiment was echoed by tax expert&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/taxgirl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kelly Phillips Erb<\/a> during a recent #AskForbes Twitter chat: &#8220;Freelancers UNDER-deduct because they&#8217;re scared of making a mistake,&#8221; she said. The way to avoid this, of course, is to consult with professionals ahead of time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cProper tax planning will allow you to take full advantage of the tax laws that are in place,\u201d added Shields.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: revert; text-align: center; color: initial;\">.<\/span><a style=\"font-size: revert; text-align: center;\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/charlieblr?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@charlieblr<\/a><span style=\"font-size: revert; text-align: center; color: initial;\"> Great question!

A lot of the time, freelancers don\u2019t try to develop those relationships until the accountant is already bogged down with 16-hour work days during the height of tax season. \u201cBy that time, we\u2019re all knee-deep in our existing clients\u2019 needs, and most of us don\u2019t have time to help you organize your receipts,\u201d said McClelland.<br>By planning ahead you can, according to McClelland, \u201cfind an accountant who you feel comfortable with, ask them a million questions, and develop a relationship with them, involving them on your team.\u201d<br><em>More: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/a-guide-to-filing-your-self-employment-taxes-in-2019\/\">A Guide to Filing Your Self-Employment Taxes in 2019<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #3: Not Saving Enough to Pay Your Taxes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you\u2019ve got bills to pay, but as a self-employed person, you also need to be wary of that big bill when tax time comes\u2014especially because you\u2019re not paying taxes every paycheck like someone who holds traditional employment.<br>That\u2019s why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.capaldireynolds.com\/anthony-c-panetta-cpa\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CPA Anthony Panetta<\/a> gives the following advice to clients: \u201cFor my clients who are starting up or who are self-employed, I like to recommend the \u2018rule of 30 percent,\u2019 meaning for every dollar brought in, save 30 cents. By doing this, it allows the business owner to budget appropriately for their total tax obligation.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He calls this a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d approach, which allows freelancers to \u201cavoid a huge tax liability all in one chunk come tax time.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read More: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/our-no-1-piece-of-advice-for-first-time-self-employed-taxpayers\/\">First Time Self-Employed Taxpayers: How to File Your Taxes<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #4: Keeping Poor Records<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/goingconcern.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Accountant and blogger Caleb Newquist<\/a> often finds that people keep \u201cinadequate or incomplete records.&#8221; Fortunately, in the 21st century, there\u2019s an easy solution for that.<br>\u201cSpring for some cloud-based accounting software,\u201d said Newquist. \u201cIt\u2019s not that expensive and they make bookkeeping easier than ever. Just sync up your bank account to the software and all the transactions feed right into it. From there, it\u2019s just a matter of a couple of clicks to categorize them in the appropriate revenue or expense account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use those numbers to help prepare your tax return.\u201d<br>(Editor&#8217;s note: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Try Fiverr Workspace<\/a> for easy invoicing, expense reports and time-tracking.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #5: Not Realizing PayPal is a Bank<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Steven Zelin, AKA \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.stevenzelin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Singing CPA<\/a>,\u201d stressed the importance of treating your PayPal transactions just as you would regular bank transactions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf customers are making payments to the company, the deposits in the PayPal account should be recognized as income. If you are paying out money from the PayPal account for business purposes (supplies, independent contractors, etc.) you should record these as business expenses. Any transfer from the PayPal to another bank account is not income or expense\u2014it\u2019s just a transfer from one bank account to another,\u201d said Zelin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides consulting with an accountant, Zelin also suggested going right to the source and reading the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS\u2019 rules<\/a>.<br><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tax-changes-freelancers-llc-s-corp\/\">2018 Tax Policy Changes: Should Freelancers Structure as an LLC or S-Corp?<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mistake #6: Mixing Personal and Business Records<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to fend off mixing your business spending and personal spending is to have a separate checking account for business use only, according to New York-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz\/stephen-m-friga-cfp-rochester\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Certified Financial Planner Stephen Friga<\/a>.<br>\u201cIn case there is ever an audit, the IRS loves to see separate records, particularly when there is a question as to whether an activity is really a business when net losses have been shown,\u201d said Friga.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the tax professionals we spoke to, though, shared one piece of advice in common: They said you should consult with them.
