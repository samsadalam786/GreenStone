But one of the biggest mistakes many freelancers make is waiting too long to start preparing for tax season. Putting things off until the filing deadline approaches adds stress, often leads to costly mistakes and missed advantages, and ends up eating into a freelancer\u2019s most precious resource &#8211; their time. With just a little prep work, April can be a month devoted to generating income, not scrambling after paperwork from multiple income streams and tracking down receipts and documents.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers have some special considerations when it comes to tax time. We\u2019ve put together some questions to consider and some helpful dates to add to your calendar, so you\u2019re ready and waiting when April rolls around.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do you need an accountant or tax-preparer?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you need to decide is whether to work with a professional tax preparer or to handle it yourself. Keep in mind that tax preparers still require you to organize documentation of income and expenses, so they don\u2019t actually take the whole thing completely off your plate. They do, however, save you time in terms of processing and filing, and their expertise can identify ways to save that might not occur to you. So, you need to consider how the time and headaches you save and the savings they may offer balance out against the costs of hiring them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">How should you choose an accountant?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you choose to outsource to a tax professional, the best way to find a good one is through your network of friends and colleagues. If you work with any attorneys, they may also be able to recommend someone. Whomever you hire must have an authorized \u201cpreparer tax identification number\u201d (PTIN) to prepare federal income tax returns. Be sure you understand their fees, which are generally based on the complexity of your return. Avoid any firm that takes a percentage of your refund. The IRS provides a link to the <a href=\"https:\/\/irs.treasury.gov\/rpo\/rpo.jsf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS directory of preparers<\/a>, which you can search by credentials and location, as well as offering additional tips about what to look for. Of course, you can also browse the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/gigs\/tax-preparation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fiverr Marketplace<\/a> for a tax preparation service that may suit your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">How should you compile your documents?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of January, start checking that you have documentation from all of your clients, as well as from your financial institutions and others with whom you did business during the last calendar year. Make sure to <strong>contact anyone you haven\u2019t heard from by<\/strong> <strong>the first week of February <\/strong>and<strong> <\/strong>check that the information matches your own records on each form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common forms include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>1099 forms for income from incorporated clients<\/li><li>1099-MISC for non-employee compensation, particular to independent contractors&nbsp;<\/li><li>1099-DIV for dividends<\/li><li>1099-INT for interest&nbsp;<\/li><li>1099-B from brokers that reports losses and gains on gains and losses on securities transactions, (due by mid-February)<\/li><li>1098 for interest paid on a housing mortgage&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">How do you deal with receipts?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Staying organized year-round is much more efficient than scrambling as deadlines approach. In fact, such scrambling can lead to costly errors and omissions. Make both paper and virtual files for hard copy and electronic receipts. The minute you receive one, make sure it goes directly into the appropriate folder.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep bills you issue organized. If you are working with a business management system like Fiverr Workspace, it will do this for you automatically and all you\u2019ll need to do is hit \u201cdownload\u201d when the time comes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How will you get the most from your deductions?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All taxpayers are entitled to a standard deduction, a portion of your income that isn\u2019t subject to tax and reduces your bill. The IRS calculates the amount based on filing status, age, and whether you are disabled or claimed as a dependent on someone else\u2019s return. It\u2019s adjusted each year for inflation.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll need to choose whether you want to itemize your deductions or claim a standard deduction. Taking the standard deduction is much easier than itemizing because it doesn\u2019t require you to keep track of qualifying expenses and receipts, then calculate and report them. But considering all the things you can deduct if you itemize, it\u2019s often not as cost-effective for freelancers.&nbsp; Given the range of deductions available to full-time freelancers, itemization is often an advantage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If itemizing, deductible expenses include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Home office, which means some portion of your mortgage or rent may be claimed. The IRS has a nifty calculator you can use.<\/li><li>Educational expenses&nbsp;<\/li><li>Depreciation of property and equipment, even if it does not need immediate replacement<\/li><li>Travel expenses, whether public transportation costs or costs relating to your car (or other privately owned vehicle of almost any sort)<\/li><li>Business travel expenses beyond transportation, which include food and lodging&nbsp;<\/li><li>Cell phone equipment purchases, fees, and maintenance<\/li><li>Computer and printer purchases, software, and maintenance<\/li><li>Health insurance and additional costs, though they may be subject too <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/taxtopics\/tc502#:~:text=You%2520may%2520deduct%2520only%2520the,Schedule%2520A%2520(Form%25201040).\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">limits<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li><li>Other expenses costs, such as business insurance, bank fees and business interest, startup costs, advertising, consulting and professional service fees, self-employment tax (see below), retirement savings, the qualified business income deduction, tax advice, property taxes and investment-related expenses, and charitable donations&nbsp;<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional details and how-to information about all of these is readily available on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nerdwallet.com\/article\/taxes\/self-employment-tax-deductions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">What if the April deadline is approaching and you\u2019re not ready?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need more time, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/articles\/personal-finance\/021314\/how-file-tax-extension.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">request an extension<\/a> to October 15th. File your request by the regular April 15 deadline to avoid penalties and interest. To request an extension by mail, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/forms-pubs\/about-form-4868\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use form<em> <\/em>4868<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is the difference between Income Tax and Self-employment Tax?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Income tax <\/strong>is the tax all citizens pay on their annual income. A progressive tax, the percentage is based on tax brackets, such that the more you make the higher <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/irs-provides-tax-inflation-adjustments-for-tax-year-2022\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your tax rate<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Self-employment tax<\/strong> is just for those who work for themselves, which comes out to 15.3% of your net income &#8211; 12.4% for Social Security and 2.9% for Medicare. (If your net earnings exceed $200,000, you may also be responsible for an additional 0.9% contribution to Medicare.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><meta charset=\"utf-8\">Do I have to pay all my taxes together at once?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not at all! In fact, the IRS allows you to pay \u201cQuarterly Tax Estimates\u201d to avoid the \u201ctax shock\u201d of hefty payments at the end of the tax year. Simply estimate your quarter\u2019s earnings and submit the appropriate percent as payment with form<em> <\/em>1040-ES by mail, or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pay online<\/a>. You can even pay by phone or mobile device, using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/newsroom\/irs2goapp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS2Go app<\/a>. Set dates for quarterly filing are listed in the calendar below.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, you will still need to file your annual return at the end of the tax year. At that time, you\u2019ll need to calculate how much you owe across the full year. If you underestimated your quarterly payments, you\u2019ll have to pay the balance with your return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.irs.gov\/payments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IRS.gov\/payments <\/a>to view all your payment options.
