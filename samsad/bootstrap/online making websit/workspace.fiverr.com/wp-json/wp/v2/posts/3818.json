So far, they\u2019ve been super communicative, and the project they want you to work on sounds like it\u2019s right up your alley.<br \/>\nBefore long, you see that inevitable question appear in your inbox: \u201cSo, what\u2019s your rate?\u201d<br \/>\nYou take one more look at the project requirements and deadline, and then send back a friendly, \u201cI would charge $800 for the entire project, including a one-week revision period!\u201d<br \/>\nSooner than you expected (you\u2019ve grown used to the freelance waiting game by now), you receive a reply. \u201cWe\u2019d really love to work with you,\u201d that email explains, \u201cBut, our budget for this project is only $500.\u201d<br \/>\nYou feel like you\u2019ve been punched in the gut\u2014that price is significantly lower than what you were hoping for, but you were really excited about this gig. So, what do you do? You have no choice but to write them off with a friendly note and then go your separate ways, right? After all, money talks and you\u2019ve got bills to pay.<br \/>\nHey, not so fast! Listen, I get where you\u2019re coming from. You freelance because you love it, but you also do it to put food on the table. It\u2019s your livelihood, which means it\u2019s far too easy to become focused solely on the paycheck you\u2019ll receive, and nothing else.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnon-monetary-perks-of-freelance-gigs%2F&#038;text=Paycheck%20aside%2C%20there%27s%20more%20to%20consider%20when%20evaluating%20%23freelance%20gigs.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Paycheck aside, there&#039;s more to consider when evaluating #freelance gigs. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnon-monetary-perks-of-freelance-gigs%2F&#038;text=Paycheck%20aside%2C%20there%27s%20more%20to%20consider%20when%20evaluating%20%23freelance%20gigs.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\nHowever, evaluating projects and clients isn\u2019t always quite that black and white. In fact, there are some other non-monetary things you\u2019ll want to consider before officially kicking that lower-paying client to the curb.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Major\u00a0exposure<\/h3>\n<p>Did you just cringe at the sight of the word \u201cexposure\u201d? I don\u2019t blame you. Any freelancer is all too familiar with those gigs that offer zero pay\u2014but promise tons of exposure. Ugh, gag.<br \/>\nBut, when there really is some money on the table (albeit, a smaller chunk than you were anticipating), exposure really is something worth giving some thought to.<br \/>\nWould taking on this project allow you to put your name on something big? Would it be shared with a large audience, expand your reach, and increase your chances of taking your freelance business to the next level?<br \/>\nIncome is important. But, so is your reputation\u2014and, if accepting this project at a slightly lower rate is going to give you major credibility, it\u2019s definitely worth considering.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Entry to a\u00a0new field<\/h3>\n<p>Up until now, your workload has been somewhat random. For example, you\u2019ve done websites for everything from dentist offices to credit unions. In a dream world, you\u2019d focus solely on developing sites for creative entrepreneurs\u2014but, you\u2019ve struggled to land just one client in that niche.<br \/>\nThis lower-rate project would allow you to gain entry to that field and get your foot in the door with more of your ideal clients. As you know too well, if you do great work, that client will be all the more willing to recommend you to the people in their own network.<br \/>\nSo, don\u2019t neglect to think about whether or not accepting this gig would be a step in the right direction for you and your portfolio\u2014even if the paycheck isn\u2019t quite what you were hoping for.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Beneficial\u00a0relationships<\/h3>\n<p>Similarly, you should consider the relationship that accepting this project would grant you. Is the person you would be working for a real influencer or go-getter? Could they be a great mentor or advocate for you?<br \/>\nI\u2019ll spare you the old clich\u00e9, \u201cYour network is your net worth,\u201d sentiment. But, really, it holds some water.<br \/>\nIf you could walk away from this gig with an awesome new connection in your back pocket, what you\u2019d receive might far outweigh the extra bucks you\u2019d lose.<\/p>\n<h3>4. New challenges<\/h3>\n<p>It can be easy to get stuck in a freelance rut. You crank out project after project, and you get comfortable with the tasks you do on a daily basis.<br \/>\nHowever, in order to stay relevant\u2014not to mention engaged and fulfilled by your work\u2014you need to push yourself out of your comfort zone every now and then and see what new directions you can take your skills.<br \/>\nDoes this gig present a challenge that would force you to try new things? Does it involve subject matter you\u2019re not exactly an expert in? Would the skills you\u2019d need to refine in order to complete this project strengthen your overall reputation as a freelancer?<br \/>\nI know, taking on something that intimidates you can be, well, intimidating. But, you want to be moving forward as a freelancer\u2014not backwards. And, that rule doesn\u2019t just apply to your income. It applies to your skillset too!<\/p>\n<h3>5. Growth opportunities<\/h3>\n<p>Freelancing can differ pretty greatly from a traditional career. However, this one thing typically holds true for both: If you can do great work and prove your value, you\u2019re bound to climb the ladder.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s worth doing some digging to figure out if this project is just a starting point that could lead to more regular work, higher pay, and an overall opportunity to grow with that client.<br \/>\nRegular, consistent, and predictable work is the dream for nearly every freelancer (buh bye, feast or famine stress!). And, if there\u2019s opportunity for something like that with this client? It\u2019s definitely worth a second look.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnon-monetary-perks-of-freelance-gigs%2F&#038;text=If%20you%20can%20do%20great%20work%20and%20prove%20your%20value%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20bound%20to%20climb%20the%20ladder.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">If you can do great work and prove your value, you\u2019re bound to climb the ladder. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fnon-monetary-perks-of-freelance-gigs%2F&#038;text=If%20you%20can%20do%20great%20work%20and%20prove%20your%20value%2C%20you%E2%80%99re%20bound%20to%20climb%20the%20ladder.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Over to you<\/h3>\n<p>No, I\u2019m by no means advocating that you should constantly sell yourself short and bend on your rates\u2014you know what you\u2019re worth.

You ask about the perks and benefits. You consider the location and commute, the schedule and hours, and the daily tasks and responsibilities.<br \/>\nFreelancing should work that very same way.
