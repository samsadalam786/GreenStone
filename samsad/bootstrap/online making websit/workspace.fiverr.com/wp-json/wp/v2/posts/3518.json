Nowadays, the definition is expanded to the more broadly-used \u201cindependent worker,\u201d a term ascribed to self-employed people of general traits and talents who share one thing in common: freedom.<br \/>\nHere are the common categories of independent workers.<\/p>\n<h3>The Freelancer<\/h3>\n<p>A freelancer is a person who sells work by the hour, day, month or project who typically seeks employment from multiple companies rather than holding a full-time job at any single company. Traditionally, \u201cfreelancer\u201d has been most-applied to creative professionals (writers, designers, performers and the like), but today, \u201cfreelancers\u201d span nearly every industry: from programming and event planning to analytics and accounting.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/thenextweb.com\/insider\/2016\/04\/20\/generation-freelancer-freelancing-exploding\/#.tnw_WOKoyyaT\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Next Web<\/a>, over a third of the U.S. workforce has done some type of freelance work over the last year, and some studies indicate that freelancers tend to earn more than full-time employees\u2014though this will be directly tied to the individual and the nature of his or her work. The Freelancers Union estimates that 40 percent of the American workforce will be freelance by 2020, largely due to the rise of technology and lean organizations.<br \/>\nFreelance writer Annie Maguire, who just recently <a href=\"https:\/\/learn.anniemaguire.com\/from-full-time-to-freelance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published a book<\/a> sharing the wisdom she\u2019s learned by going from fulltime to freelance, said she values the ability to choose clients as an independent worker.<br \/>\n\u201cI look for clients who I know will respect me, my time, and value, and refuse to settle for anything less,\u201d she said. \u201c[Anything else] is not worth the stress!\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The Self-Employed Consultant<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that the various categories of independent workers can have a lot of crossover. Consider the labels \u201cfreelancer\u201d and \u201cself-employed consultant,\u201d for example. Whereas freelancers might envision themselves as serving multiple clients, someone who identifies as a self-employed consultant operates as the head of their own business entity.<\/p>\n<p>The differences are nuanced, yet the uptick in people calling themselves \u201cself-employed\u201d is indicative of a broader workforce revolution in which <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-evolution-of-careers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">power is shifting<\/a> from employers to individuals. One important distinction between freelance and self-employed: control. Per the IRS, \u201can individual is an independent contractor if the payer has the right to control or direct only the result of the work and not what will be done and how it will be done.\u201d<br \/>\nIn other words, you\u2019re your own boss.<\/p>\n<h3>The Founder or Business Owner<\/h3>\n<p>A founder, or business owner, is able to take an immense amount of pride in their work, as well as shares a great amount of responsibility. While founders might start out small and independent, the end goal is likely to scale into a fully-fledged organization. To that end, a key difference between founders and self-employed workers is the desire to scale (or lack thereof).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/toridantono\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Tori Dantono<\/a> is founder of a strategy firm tasked with driving brand growth. She says the most rewarding part about being a business owner is the constant learning and growth. \u201cA business owner every day is developmental and there\u2019s nothing quite as gratifying as seeing both individuals and the firm continuously grow and evolve,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<h3>The Entrepreneur<\/h3>\n<p>An entrepreneur is someone who organizes and manages a business and assumes the risks associated with launching the enterprise. The term \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/no-regrets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">solopreneur<\/a>\u201d has also entered the lexicon, specifying a situation in which an entrepreneur is running the business (and assuming the risk) by him or herself.<br \/>\nDoug Ricket, Founder &amp; CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.payjoy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Payjoy, Inc.<\/a>, likens being an entrepreneur to a \u201crocket ship.\u201d Payjoy is the fourth company he has founded, but the first that has received VC funding.<br \/>\n\u201cThe day-to-day experience [of an entrepreneur] varies from season to season,\u201d explains Ricket. \u201cEarly last year, we were working on our Series A fundraising, meeting potential investors; later in the year, we [focused on] recruiting great people. Now, we&#8217;re \u2026 focused on execution of the core business, making the product even stronger for our customers and pursuing growth opportunities.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>The Part-Time Side-Hustler<\/h3>\n<p>A side-hustler is someone who has regular income and also works on another job or passion project. Some side-hustlers realize over time that their side gigs are perhaps more fulfilling or more financially beneficial\u2014or, if you\u2019re lucky, both\u2014than their full-time job and so they decide to jump into those endeavors full-time.<br \/>\nWe recently profiled seven ambitious independent workers who parlayed their side-hustles into full-time careers, and you can read about them <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/success-tips-from-side-hustlers\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>The Digital Nomad<\/h3>\n<p>There is no ignoring the <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/remote-work-revolution\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">remote work<\/a> movement these days\u2014and for some people, their remote work adventures take them around the world. Led by millennials, who are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/sarah-clark\/4-ways-millennials-are-ch_b_10503146.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more likely to travel abroad<\/a> than previous generations, digital nomads are on the rise.<br \/>\n\u201c[Digital nomadism] comes down to building a life that you find fulfilling while hopefully learning a lot about an interesting place in the process,\u201d said Jodi Ettenberg of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.legalnomads.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Legal Nomads<\/a>, a blog she started when she quit her job as a lawyer nine years ago.<br \/>\nEttenberg\u2019s advice for aspiring nomads: Do your homework first. Shore up a savings account, and make a list of the skills that can be applied remotely. \u201c[Without preparation], what can be freeing\u2014trying your hand at a very unconventional life\u2014quickly becomes a place you are trapped if you haven&#8217;t planned ahead of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s next: The Slash Worker<\/h3>\n<p>As the gig economy continues to swell with a more diverse mix of independent workers, a new term has been introduced by Fiverr Workspace co-founder Leif Abraham: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/meet-the-new-breed-of-the-gig-economy-the-slash-worker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Slash Worker<\/a>. This term aptly describes the complex and fragmented nature of modern career paths, with an increasing number of professionals vying to dice up their talents into a range of services that can be sold to earn a living.<br \/>\nFor example, perhaps you know a \u201cWriter \/ Producer \/ Content Strategist\u201d or an \u201cModel \/ Actor \/ Software Developer.\u201d In both scenarios, the independent workers represent multiple talents and collect from multiple revenue streams.<br \/>\n\u201cWhereas our parents stuck to a job for the lifetime of their career, the modern worker doesn\u2019t always commit to just one company,\u201d writes Abraham. \u201cContrary to prior generations, Slash Workers have shrugged the \u201csingle profession, single employer\u201d model in favor of building a portfolio of career opportunities for themselves.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of how you choose to define yourself as an independent worker, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a> believes that there should be a single worker classification for this group\u2014not many. Technology can help by introducing systems that eliminate the complexities inherent in the various classifications of workers and emulate how it would be if there was just one worker classification.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As the gig economy grows, the various labels for independent workers proliferate.
