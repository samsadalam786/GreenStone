It will help you get more done, charge what you\u2019re worth, and grow your business.<br \/>\nBelow, we\u2019ll explain the power behind using a time-tracker for your freelance business with four solid, business-impacting reasons:<\/p>\n<h2>1. Using a time-tracker improves your time-management<\/h2>\n<p>First, using a simple time-tracking tool will help you improve your time management skills as a freelancer.<br \/>\nBecause time is your most valuable asset, you need to make every minute count. After all, as a freelancer, if you&#8217;re not working, you&#8217;re not earning.<br \/>\nPlus, freelancers who stay organized and productive are far more likely to have satisfied\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-turn-one-time-job-listings-into-long-term-freelance-clients\">clients that come back to them month after month<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe trouble is, it\u2019s easy to fall into the illusion that you are being productive when you actually aren\u2019t, so give yourself a fighting chance and rely on technology (and not your gut) to track your time.<br \/>\nFor example,\u00a0let\u2019s say you are building a landing page for a client.<br \/>\nBoth of you agree that 24 billable hours would be a reasonable time for the completion of the project. Or you factor that into your \u201cby project\u201d or \u201cvalue-based\u201d bid.<br \/>\nSince you normally work eight hours per day, you anticipate that the landing page will be ready in three days.<br \/>\nAt the end of the second day, you realize that you aren\u2019t even done with half of the items you need to complete. Uh oh. You\u2019ve completely bid this wrong. You know you have invested 16 hours, but the landing page looks like if you have barely worked 10.<br \/>\nYour first thought is to ask the client for a deadline extension. But, how will you justify it? Who will pay for the extra hours?<br \/>\nIn the best case, you may have to work extra for free. In the worst, your client will exceed his budget and this will be your last project with them.<br \/>\nThis all could have been avoided if you had historical time-tracking data to help you give a better bid.<br \/>\nThat\u2019s because a time-tracker will help you see where your time is going and make corrections when needed. All in all,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\">tracking your time will help you be more productive and even happier as a freelancer<\/a>.<br \/>\nIf this scenario sounds all too familiar, you can start solving the problem by\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">signing up for our free time-tracker<\/a>. It\u2019s crazy easy to use, fast and available on all devices.<\/p>\n<h2>2. A time-tracker can increase your output (and revenue)<\/h2>\n<p>When you know where you\u2019re spending your time, you\u2019re able to focus on the revenue-generating activities in your business. And, naturally, your business grows as a result.<br \/>\nFor many freelancers, their computer is a critical tool.<br \/>\nBut your computer can also be a huge distraction.<br \/>\nAt your fingertips, you\u2019ve got non-billable tasks like paying bills, sending invoices, taking calls with prospects, marketing your services, etc. \u2014 not to mention all the distractions of social media, email, and news.<br \/>\nSo do you know how much time you are actually spending on non-billable tasks? Are you counting them as \u201cworking hours\u201d? Are there any tasks you should de-prioritize or even automate?<br \/>\nWhen you know what activities provide a higher return on investment, you can prioritize with a clear perspective \u2014 and convert that clearer perspective into more\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-some-freelancers-bring-in-big-money-while-others-struggle-to-find-work\">freelance revenue<\/a>.<br \/>\nIn the same way, a time-tracker can help you find the bright spots in your freelance business. When you know which\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/ryrob.com\/freelance-jobs\">freelance jobs<\/a>\u00a0bring in the most revenue, you can leave your low-performing clients behind, freeing you up to make more money for less work.<br \/>\nAs you can see, tracking your time opens the door to awareness, and such awareness can be turned easily into opportunities. Opportunities to improve, live better, and make more money as a freelancer.<\/p>\n<h2>3. Tracking your time helps you understand what you should charge<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.creativelive.com\/blog\/how-to-set-rates-that-work\/\">Most freelancers charge too little<\/a>\u00a0for the work they complete, and that\u2019s usually because they work more hours than they think.<br \/>\nA time tracker will help you differentiate between \u201coffice hours\u201d and \u201cbillable hours\u201d as mentioned in the previous section.<br \/>\nAnd once you know your times, divide your total needed revenue by the total number of billable hours you work in a month to see how much you should be charging by the hour.<br \/>\nFor even more information on how to charge your services correctly, take a look at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.fiverr.com\/know-your-worth-how-to-price-your-services-correctly\/\">this how-to guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>4. Keeping track of your time helps you work more efficiently<\/h2>\n<p>Finally, tracking your time (even if it doesn\u2019t change what you charge) makes you more aware of where you\u2019re spending your efforts.<br \/>\nI am sure you have noticed there are moments of your workday where you feel like a genius and that everything is possible. But then the opposite happens at other, more frustrating parts of the day.<br \/>\nTime tracking will help you see those flow-state moments (or gaps) and allow you to plan your day so you maximize your efforts.<br \/>\nThe same principles also apply to idle time or unconscious habits. Some examples of these habits could be going to the restroom often, checking social media during work hours, or anything that takes up a lot of your time without you knowing.<br \/>\nFor example, if you notice you take a 1-hour Netflix break every day at lunch, you can shrink that to a half-hour (or skip it) in order to gain back some billable hours.<br \/>\nHow much would you make with 5 extra paid hours per week? If you charge a very reasonable rate of $100\/hour, you could make an extra $2,000\/mo just by cutting back on one bad habit.<br \/>\nThese small actions can add up over time as you literally take control of your time, ensuring your freelance business lasts a long time and you maintain an equal balance between work and life.<\/p>\n<h2>How to get started with freelance time tracking<\/h2>\n<p>Ok&#8230;this is all fine and good. Of course, it makes sense to be tracking your time \u2014 even if you don\u2019t charge by the hour.<br \/>\nBut you may be wondering, \u201cso, what\u2019s next?\u201d or \u201chow can I actually get started with time tracking as a freelancer?\u201d<br \/>\nHonestly, this is something very simple to implement. In fact, you can probably do it in less time than it took you to read this article. You just need to\u00a0find a good, reliable time tracker\u00a0and put it to work.<br \/>\nWe suggest you take a look at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">our time-tracking app<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 built directly into the AND.CO software.<br \/>\nNot only is it completely free to try, but it also connects to your AND.CO invoicing to automatically send client invoices based on the hours you\u2019re tracking. It\u2019s pretty brilliant.<br \/>\nIn addition, you can share your latest time sheets with clients if you so choose and track time from literally anywhere with\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">our desktop or mobile apps<\/a>.<br \/>\nHowever you decide to do it, tracking your time can make a huge impact on your productivity, pricing, time-management, and overall output. If you\u2019re not paying close attention to your hours, maybe it\u2019s \u2018<em>time<\/em>\u2019 you did. (I couldn\u2019t help myself.)<\/p>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The phrase \u201ctime is money\u201d is especially true if you&#8217;re a freelancer.
