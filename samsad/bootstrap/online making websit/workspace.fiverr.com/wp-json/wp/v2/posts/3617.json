A contract sets the tone for your working relationship, provides a scope of work to consult if a client gets overly demanding, and also gives you a legal basis to fall back on if things go sour and you\u2019re owed some money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a legal background, creating a freelance contract for your business can seem a bit daunting. And if you\u2019re just getting started with freelancing, you might not have a lot of extra money in the bank for one-on-one legal guidance.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what\u2019s a freelancer to do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In partnership with <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freelancersunion.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancers Union<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Fiverr Workspace has created an in-depth\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/app.and.co\/contracts\/create\/project\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">freelance contract template<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. To give you the best understanding of this tool, and freelance contracts in general, we outlined some of the most essential contract clauses to consider for any client relationship.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-you-should-always-use-contracts-and-agreements-as-a-freelancer\/\">Why You Should Always Use Contracts and Agreements<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Payment Terms<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To establish a level of comfort between yourself and the client, it\u2019s important to agree upon payment terms <i>before<\/i> work begins. Don\u2019t wait until after a project is done to discuss payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Determine what makes the most sense for you and your business. Here are a few common types of payment terms:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Due on receipt<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Payment is due when the client receives an invoice.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Net 30, net 60, etc.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Payment is due 30 (or 60, etc.) days after invoice is sent.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Upfront payment<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: The best way to make sure you\u2019re covered is to require payment <em>before<\/em> the project begins. <\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Split payments<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: For a large project, you might ask for half of the payment up front, half upon completion, or several payments throughout, based on different\u00a0project milestones.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may have your own preferences, but it\u2019s likely that the client company\u2019s accounting\/accounts payable department also has certain guidelines to be followed. Be open to negotiation here, but make sure that whatever you work out with the client, you\u2019re comfortable with the situation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because payment is so important to the freelancer who doesn\u2019t receive a steady paycheck, and can be a point of contention, consider additional contract clauses on your freelance contract template to ensure that it happens on time. (Add these into your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/free-invoice-templates\">free invoice template in Fiverr Workspace<\/a> too).\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some freelancers charge a late fee if payment isn\u2019t received within a set amount of time. You might instead consider a reward for an on-time payment instead of the standard late payment &#8220;punishment&#8221; (although both can be a motivator).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a client pays early, or on time, some freelancers will opt to offer a small discount\u2014perhaps 3 to 5 percent of the invoice total. Before discounting your services, increase the price charged according to the contract to offset\u00a0this \u201cdiscount.\u201d By motivating clients in this way, you get paid on time, your client feels good about doing it, and you can still pocket\u00a0100 percent of the money you&#8217;ve earned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/a-complete-guide-to-becoming-a-freelancer\/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-5679\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/becoming-a-freelancer-6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"201\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Scope of Work<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6331\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/the-freelance-contract-1.png\" alt=\"the-freelance-contract and co from fiverr\" width=\"408\" height=\"451\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An important consideration for your freelance contract template is to define the scope of work for every client, in as much detail as possible. This is where Fiverr Workspace&#8217;S &#8216;Project Details&#8217; option comes in super handy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A scope of work lays out the specifics as to what you\u2019ll be providing to a client as part of your working relationship. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you lay\u00a0out the scope of work (SOW).<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Avoid making guarantees<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, unless that\u2019s something you\u2019ve explicitly promised a customer. For example, if you\u2019re creating a contract for SEO services, don\u2019t guarantee first page results. Instead, use the scope of work to share how you\u2019ll be implementing SEO best practices to\u00a0positively influence ranking.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Be as specific as possible<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with deliverables. For example, if you\u2019re offering social media marketing services, how many platforms will you be posting on? Are you creating content, or just scheduling it? Will you be running ads? How much budget will you handle? Will you spend time on engagement activities? How much time each month? Regardless of your niche, it\u2019s important to think through <\/span><\/b><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">every<\/span><\/em><b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> detail. Defining the scope of work will also serve as a roadmap for you\u00a0when you formally kick off the project.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Define complementary activities<\/strong>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Will you be executing any one time setup activities as part of an ongoing agreement? Are you guaranteeing a certain number of meetings each month? The more detail you use to flesh out your freelance contract template, the more protective you can be of your time, especially if a client is\u00a0showing signs of &#8220;scope creep.&#8221;<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve created a detailed scope of work, use it to keep yourself honest, and to fall back on if a client gets more demanding than what they\u2019re actually paying for.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>More:\u00a0<\/strong>Looking for more tools and resources for freelancers? <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/tools-resources-for-freelancers\/\">Find 600+ here<\/a>.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>Ownership Rights<\/h3>\n<p>It might seem logical that if a client pays for your work, they should retain ownership rights. But in some situations, it doesn\u2019t make sense to give up your ownership rights completely.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, your freelance contract template should include a clause that allows you to retain ownership rights if it makes sense for your business. For example, if you\u2019re a writer creating an article for an online publication, you could potentially make additional income by retaining your ownership rights, and republishing your article in a print publication. Depending on the outlet of the original piece, you may get pushback on this clause. Determine on a case-by-case basis where it makes sense to retain ownership rights.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, you may be more interested in being able to share finished work on your portfolio than keeping ownership rights. If a company requires you to sign an Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), this likely won\u2019t be possible (though it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask!). Fiverr Workspace\u2019s contract tool, for example, allows you to define the specifics regarding either situation if they are important to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On that note, your freelance contract template should include clauses for everything that you deem crucial for your business. Some additional considerations, based on common freelance issues, include:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Kill fee<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If a client backs out of a project, this ensures that you still get paid for work already completed.<\/span><\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Limited revisions<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: It\u2019s fairly common practice to offer at least one revision on a project (especially if you\u2019re just getting to know the client), but payment for excessive revisions should be built into your freelance contract template.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Expenses<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you need to assume expenses on behalf of a client to complete a project (travel, software, etc.), the terms need to be defined ahead of time, especially with consideration as to who\u2019s responsible for said expenses.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Handling of Disputes<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>:<\/strong> Legal considerations for how issues will be handled. If you\u2019re in different states, this could be especially important.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>For more on contracts and agreements, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/caitlin-pearce?utm_source=ANDCOblog&amp;utm_medium=contracts\">listen to this episode of the Six Figure Freelancer Audio Course<\/a>, where Caitlin Pearce of Freelancer&#8217;s Union talks about why you should always use a contract.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Freelance Contract Template: Essential Contract Clauses<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each industry and freelance working relationship are unique.
