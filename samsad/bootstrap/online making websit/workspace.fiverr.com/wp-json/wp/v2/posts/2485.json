There\u2019s even <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">an app for crowdsourcing the best coffee shops to work from<\/a> in more than 1,250 cities worldwide.<br \/>\nEstimates indicate that the freelancers comprise <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/elainepofeldt\/2016\/10\/06\/new-survey-freelance-economy-shows-rapid-growth\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">35 percent of the total U.S. workforce<\/a>\u2014a figure that is predicted to balloon to 40 percent by 2020. With a large share of the 55 million freelancers relying on coffee shops as mobile workspaces, these businesses have been shifting their approaches to create more freelance-friendly environments. But what can (and should) freelancers be doing to return the favor?<br \/>\nWe spoke with managers at some of the busiest cafes\u00a0in Brooklyn to get insight into what constitutes the proper etiquette for freelancers who spend their days camped out amid the warm aromas and acoustic soundtrack of their favorite neighborhood coffee shop.<\/p>\n<h3>Be kind to your baristas<\/h3>\n<p>You know the ever-friendly person serving up your latte behind the counter? Their skills stretch far beyond that kickass latte art. (Though, we would like to meet the creative mastermind behind this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/unicorn-latte-looks-too-beautiful-144045993.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">glorious unicorn latte<\/a>, found at East Williamsburg&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thendbrooklyn.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The End<\/a> coffee shop.)<br \/>\nConnan Moody, manager of the popular coffee shop <a href=\"https:\/\/freeholdbrooklyn.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freehold<\/a>, explains that most baristas find their passion in other places. \u201cMany of us are designers, actors, artists or students,\u201d he says. Who knows? Beyond starting the day with a smile and a friendly face, taking the time to get to know your barista could help motivate or inspire your next project.<br \/>\n\u201cI&#8217;ve been able to connect\u00a0freelancers and designers with people who need their services, and I love that,\u201d says Moody. Plus, if you start developing friendships with staff, they\u2019ll be more inclined tell you about hidden outlets or give you a free cup of joe.<\/p>\n<h3>Sharing is caring, so scooch on over<\/h3>\n<p>In many ways, a local coffee shop reflects its own contained community. Sharing your space with others and exercising courtesy at the most fundamental level will help ensure that the good vibes keep flowing from dawn to dusk.<br \/>\nThe notion of sharing becomes very clear when applied to a cafe\u2019s most-coveted resource: the rare and valuable power outlet. Although some coffeeshops are built with a remote workforce in mind\u2014Brooklyn\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gotannyc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gotan<\/a> seems to have more outlets than coffee beans\u2014most only have a few outlets to share among dozens of patrons.<br \/>\nThe basic rule, according to Jonathan Dreszer, General Manager at the uber-trendy <a href=\"https:\/\/www.devocion.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Devocion<\/a>: If you\u2019re lucky enough to nab an outlet, try not to hog it, and unplug after you\u2019re fully charged. While Dreszer says he loves all of the creative regulars that come through his doors everyday, he admits that \u201cpeople connecting their laptops while running wires through the space\u201d can be a pet peeve.<br \/>\nIn general, the \u201ctake what you need and leave the rest\u201d rule applies to any resource or space at a coffee shop that is intended to be shared among all patrons. Refrain from laptop-spreading across multiple chairs and tables and you might just meet a like-minded freelancer who is down to collaborate on a new business venture. If not, perhaps your new table-mate will kindly watch your stuff when it\u2019s time for a bathroom or walking break.<\/p>\n<h3>In summary, use your common sense<\/h3>\n<p>As a self-employed person or entrepreneur, it\u2019s likely you didn\u2019t get there by ignoring your gut instincts or alienating people along the way. Of course, as a hustler you know how to leverage all a coffee shop has to offer to help you knock out that awesome pitch email or newsletter design with time to spare for side-hustles two and three.<br \/>\nThat said, use your common sense. Keep your phone or Skype conversations to a low volume\u2014and keep them short. Be polite to waitstaff. Clean up your area when you\u2019re done for the day. Tip your barista. Smile, share and don\u2019t be afraid to chat up your neighbors. You\u2019d be surprised at what\u2019s out there when you lift the Beats by Dre from your ear.<br \/>\nWhile coffee shops can feel more relaxed than an office, Freehold\u2019s Moody emphasizes that it\u2019s important to respect them as shared spaces that are home to different types of people who are there for different reasons. Bustling cafes thrive off of the camaraderie of people chatting and chilling out, but that must coexist with the readers and quiet workers among us.<br \/>\n*****<br \/>\nOnce you start appreciating your local cafe as more than a hub for free WiFi and a quick caffeine fix, you\u2019ll realize that these businesses are unique and core to the freelance lifestyle. Respect the coffee shop; respect the hustle.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We spoke with managers at some of the busiest and buzziest coffee shops in Brooklyn to understand the
