Portland\u2019s about many things\u2014craft beer, food trucks, and a burgeoning arts scene. It\u2019s also a great place to enjoy far simpler pleasures like walkable neighborhoods and a plethora of <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/portland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fine local haunts<\/a> that are conducive to an afternoon of productive remote work.<br \/>\nIt also happens to be an excellent place for freelancers to work on their trade. Why? There\u2019s a great infrastructure for gig workers to thrive. There\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/codeoregon.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free and low-cost classes<\/a> to keep your skills on the bleeding edge. New coworking spaces are popping up on a weekly basis. Plus, plenty of quality meetups for networking and intellectual stimulation. And coffeehouses. <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/search?q=&amp;l=&amp;g=Portland%2C+OR%2C+United+States&amp;ll=45.52306220000001%2C-122.67648159999999&amp;gid=ChIJJ3SpfQsLlVQRkYXR9ua5Nhw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lots of them<\/a>.<br \/>\nI spoke with Darren Buckner, the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workfrom<\/a>, as well as Jehn Glynn, the co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thecreativeroundtable.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Creative Roundtable<\/a>, a Portland-based organization dedicated to the support and guidance of creative entrepreneurs. They provided their insider perspectives on Portland&#8217;s place as a hub in the gig economy.<\/p>\n<h3>Opportunity Knocks<\/h3>\n<p>Portland\u2019s location plays an important role in its success: \u201cThe city is part of that culture of West Coast entrepreneurship,\u201d says Buckner.<br \/>\nThe budding tech industry and growing base of knowledge workers create an innovative and engaging atmosphere. There\u2019s a strong creative scene that propels the work of a lot of agencies and creates a ton of opportunities for client-based work. \u201cPortland has opportunity, you just have to be willing to work for it and work with the community to sustain it,\u201d says Glynn.<br \/>\nAnd home office-based freelancers can breathe easy: high-speed internet is readily available at a reasonable cost; for speed demons, access to fiber is quickly increasing.<\/p>\n<h3>Laid-Back People<\/h3>\n<p>Laid back, collaborative, and unconventional: that describes Portlanders in a nutshell. There\u2019s a great deal of support within the community for intrepid ways of getting things done. And people are, of course, what it\u2019s all about. \u201cFinding your people in person is truly invaluable and very possible in Portland,\u201d says Glynn. Buckner agrees: \u201cYou meet folks who are crafting their days and have similar interests.\u201d<br \/>\nMake sure you don\u2019t overly rely on online networking, though. Getting out in person to <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/magazine\/story\/glyph-cafe-artistic-crossroads-portland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">engage with the vibrant community<\/a> can open many opportunities. \u201cI would tell a freelancer to not be shy about getting out into the community to meet people, ask for the help you need and offer to help as well,\u201d says Glynn.<br \/>\nGetting involved with groups such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.meetup.com\/Creative-Roundtable\/?ref=workfrom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Creative Roundtable<\/a> is an important part of getting connected. \u201cOnce they do that, they will be welcomed and celebrated for what they are doing and contributing,\u201d says Glynn, \u201cit\u2019s important to contribute to the community by helping one another, which in turn means you\u2019ll also get the help you need.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Flexible Lifestyles<\/h3>\n<p>Portland offers a great deal of support for alternative lifestyles and schedules. As Buckner puts it, \u201cCome to Portland expecting a big bonus when it comes to support for living life on your terms.\u201d This is a huge benefit for freelancers who often keep unconventional hours. \u201c[You] can craft your days and have access to great food and outdoor activities,\u201d says Buckner.<br \/>\nThose of the outdoor persuasion can easily take a break from client demands to recharge with a trip to nearby <a href=\"https:\/\/traveloregon.com\/cities-regions\/mt-hood-the-gorge\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mt. Hood<\/a> or an hour\u2019s drive to the <a href=\"https:\/\/visittheoregoncoast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Oregon coast<\/a>. And if you simply can\u2019t afford to step away, you\u2019ll find connectivity and a quality cup of joe or a microbrew in <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/solera-brewery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unexpected locations<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Room to Roam<\/h3>\n<p>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workfrom<\/a> to help you find great spaces to get things done while you\u2019re in Portland\u2014after all, it\u2019s our company\u2019s hometown.
