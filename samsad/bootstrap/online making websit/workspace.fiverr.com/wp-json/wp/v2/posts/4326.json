One of the first to-dos: setting up your freelance website. It\u2019s an important next step to building and honing your brand, not to mention cultivating a great network for yourself, but building them doesn\u2019t have to be a big time suck. Use resources like <a href=\"https:\/\/about.me\/?utm_campaign=andco&amp;utm_medium=marketing&amp;utm_source=partner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about.me<\/a> to allow you to set up a freelance website in a matter of minutes, so that you can get back to doing your work.<br \/>Instead of having yet another excuse to put off building your business, here are a few reasons why creating a simple freelance website can help you grow your audience and find new clients.<br \/><br \/><\/p>\n<h3>Simple sites save time &amp; money<\/h3>\n<p>Creating and keeping up with a full-blown website is hard. Things go wrong, you have to choose fonts, and finding the perfect images can be tricky. Plus, there are plenty of other tools that you should be spending your hard-earned money on that\u2019ll actually free up time for you to work on what matters.<br \/>Creating a simple landing page is easy to set up and can save you a lot of time and money. There\u2019s no dealing with \u201cwebsite maintenance\u201d or worrying that your site will be down right when it actually matters.<\/p>\n<h3>Simple sites resonate better with clients<\/h3>\n<p>It may seem obvious, but you have to remember that you are not the target audience of your website. Your potential client is the audience. When you create a complicated freelance website with pages and menus, it makes it overwhelming and intimidating. Potential clients don\u2019t know where to start, so sometimes they don\u2019t.<br \/>What do people want to see when they come to a freelance website? They want to know who you are and what you do. In other words, they are looking for a succinct destination to learn what your <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.about.me\/2017\/05\/10\/how-to-define-your-career-headline\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">\u201ccareer headline\u201d<\/a> is and gain some basic insight into who you are and what you do.<br \/>So, keep it simple. Your potential clients will become new clients. And your new clients will thank you.<\/p>\n<h3>Simple sites allow for more flexibility<\/h3>\n<p>Being a freelancer is an ongoing learning curve. You might describe yourself one way in a meeting that really resonates with clients, and moving forward this might be your new descriptor. You might find certain work examples are more powerful than others. You might even decide to start selling a new skill, true to \u201cSlash Worker\u201d form.<br \/>Optimizing how you market yourself is part of the game, but you shouldn\u2019t have to put so much time and effort into updating your freelance website. With a simple, one-page site, you can easily tweak the copy without making major adjustments to the page architecture.<\/p>\n<p>Moral of the story? Marketing and personal branding is a core function of running your freelance business, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a time intensive effort. Simple freelance websites, done right, can be extremely effective when it comes to positioning yourself and your business in a clean and coherent fashion.<br \/><em><strong>Create an <a href=\"https:\/\/about.me\/?utm_campaign=andco&amp;utm_medium=marketing&amp;utm_source=partner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">about.me<\/a> page today so you can easily start growing your audience and getting new clients.
