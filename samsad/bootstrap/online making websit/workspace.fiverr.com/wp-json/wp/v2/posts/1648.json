Are you unsure\u00a0on how to grow\u00a0your passion project(s)&#8211;be it writing, design, or whatever gets your creative energy flowing&#8211;into a fully-fledged freelance business? Sure you do! And\u00a0you\u2019re not alone. The desire to turn your a passionate freelance gig\u00a0into a series of jobs in that field\u00a0has been around forever (way before the term freelance came around), and now it&#8217;s more possible than ever.<br \/>\nSure, finding the first freelance gigs that put you in your desired field, and then starting your own business, can be terrifying. Here\u2019s the good news, it doesn\u2019t have to be so hard if you position yourself properly. There are some tricks of the trade to\u00a0help turn that craft, writing, or any other freelance\u00a0business into a reality! Here are some tips to get you started:<\/p>\n<h2>Get on the Right Freelance Job Boards!<\/h2>\n<p>Websites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.guru.com\/\">Guru<\/a>\u00a0are great at covering a broad set of skills and building your portfolio with a diverse array of clients ad freelance gigs that define your skillset. Once you&#8217;ve scoped those two out, check out this job board for more options, with some delving into more specific searches. They connect customers with freelancers over a variety of professions\u00a0including admin, web development, sales, engineering, and finance. However, focussing on smaller, more specific job boards,\u00a0will help you reach clients who are better matched\u00a0to\u00a0the services you offer. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.designcrowd.com\/\">DesignCrowd<\/a> is a website that lists jobs solely for graphic designers, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toptal.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Toptal<\/a>\u00a0is only for software engineers. Check out this very thorough list of specific <a href=\"https:\/\/good.co\/blog\/2014\/07\/07\/list-of-100-niche-job-boards\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">job websites<\/a>, find the right board\u00a0for you, and get to work!<br \/>\nOnce you&#8217;ve targeted the ones you&#8217;re best suited for,\u00a0pursue those boards the most. That doesn&#8217;t mean giving up on other promising boards you haven&#8217;t had luck with yet. Even if you stumble with one board, but see the benefit in those projects, keep pursuing them as well! It&#8217;s your passion after all.<\/p>\n<h2>Get an SEO Optimized Website<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>If you&#8217;re an SEO pro, consider your website the first entry in your SEO portfolio.<br \/>\nFor the rest of us, gone are the days when websites were for the coding masterminds out there. With companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/\">Squarespace<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordpress.com\/\">WordPress<\/a>, building your own professional website and getting your services out into the big wide world of Google and Bing has become much easier with a little effort on your part.<br \/>\nSEO can appear like an insurmountable challenge at first, but it\u2019s important to understand. From anchor text to metadata to nofollow links, there is a multitude of facets that could change your position. Much of it is trial and error, even when the experts suggest some new trick.<br \/>\nThat&#8217;s why today, it\u2019s not enough anymore to just build a website. You need to know how to hack into the golden undercurrents of the internet\u00a0and use them to your advantage. It&#8217;s crucial\u00a0to\u00a0harness the power of your keywords effectively,\u00a0and to fill your website\u00a0with easy-to-read content with a clear message.\u00a0Check out this simple list of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/jeff-charles\/7-easy-seo-tips-for-solop_b_10489488.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO tricks<\/a>\u00a0to help your website, and your company, flourish!<br \/>\nRemember though, proper SEO takes constant work and effort. So, once you have these SEO basics covered, keep exploring on how to optimize your page until it reaches the top 3 ranks on your desired keywords.<\/p>\n<h2>Get Connected!<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/\">LinkedIn<\/a> isn\u2019t just for corporate CEOs and awkward profile pictures. Most social media sites operate with one foot in the social world, while LinkedIn has maintained its professional persona. Signing up is free, and you can start connecting with possible clients, reading industry blogs, and searching the LinkedIn job postings, without having to watch videos of ice skating rabbits. Delving further into social media, it\u2019s also important to take advantage of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/learn\/facebook-ads-basics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook Ads<\/a>. We\u2019ve all seen them, but few of us use them! Check out this <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hootsuite.com\/social-media-advertising\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">great guide<\/a> from Hootsuite about advertising on social media. The benefits (and freelance gigs you land) can be immense.<br \/>\nRemember to venture off of social media as well! That&#8217;s because everything from your local coworking spaces to professional networks to even a mentor can drastically improve your network. You never know, stopping by your local <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wework.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WeWork<\/a>\u00a0space or attending your next <a href=\"https:\/\/creativemornings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CreativeMornings<\/a>\u00a0event can turn into an opportunity to meet new people and get the ball rolling on a new project. Just like social media, the more you put yourself out there, the more likely you are to see gainful returns. And even if you only come away with a pleasant conversation, you&#8217;ve shown your personality to a fellow creative. You can&#8217;t underestimate how important it is just to get on someone&#8217;s radar.<\/p>\n<h2>Reach Out to Fellow Freelancers!<\/h2>\n<p>It takes a village. Starting a business or fleshing out a hobby isn\u2019t easy and takes determination and focus. The skills that you offer don\u2019t always align with the skills needed to start the business in the first place. If you want to take your photography business to the next level but it means keeping track of expenses and tax returns, it can seem overwhelming to the creative mind. Let Fiverr Workspace help! Your <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a> Chief Operator can deal with the back end, so you can focus on taking the perfect picture!<br \/>\nAnd remember that great conversation you had from the last section? Well, turns out they know someone who knows someone that can help your crafting with some SEO optimization you were trying to learn a few sections ago. AND turns out they have a need for some new crafts like yours&#8230;<br \/>\nSo you never know, reach out.<br \/>\nIt won&#8217;t always end up like the scenario above, but it very well could. So what&#8217;s the harm in asking, right?<\/p>\n<h2>And Remember, It&#8217;s All a Wave<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Pursuing your passion as a freelancer is almost never going to be all smooth sailing, but with some hard work you can turn choppy seas into sunnier days. Like any freelance endeavor, there will be ups and downs. Try to prepare as best as possible and learn as much as you can. Always remember to network and bring your A game.<br \/>\nIt might seem hard today, but making your dream your career is achievable.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><!--vcv no format--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you dream of the day when your passion projects\u00a0are finally your freelance career?
