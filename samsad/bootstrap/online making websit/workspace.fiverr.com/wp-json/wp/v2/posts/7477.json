Wherever you are in your career, it pays to know where to look for work.<br \/>\nLuckily for you, we\u2019re living in a golden age of sorts for freelancing. In 2019, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/90411808\/35-of-the-u-s-workforce-is-now-freelancing-10-million-more-than-5-years-ago\">57 million people<\/a> worked as freelancers in the U.S. That\u2019s up from about 53 million in 2014. In that time, multiple websites, job boards, and platforms have emerged to help freelancers get matched with clients.<br \/>\nNow, you don\u2019t have to spend as much time doing the \u201cunpaid\u201d work of looking for your next assignment. Instead, you can log onto a platform or access a website and bid on jobs. In some cases, the jobs even come to you.<br \/>\nMany freelancing platforms are designed for writers and designers. But there are also plenty of opportunities out there for freelance developers, bookkeepers, marketers, and other types of consultants. You can even be a freelance scientist.<br \/>\nThis list isn\u2019t exhaustive, but below are a few of the best platforms you can use to find work as a freelance writer, as well as expand your talents to other fields if you choose!<\/p>\n<h2>Fiverr<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_medium=blog\">Fiverr<\/a> is one of the most popular freelancing platforms out there.<br \/>\nIt hosts millions of freelancers from across the globe, and 2.4 million customers bought services there in 2019. Clients go to Fiverr to look for freelancers skilled in writing, programming, graphic design, digital marketing, animation, music, and much, much more \u2014 there are over 300 categories for digital services.<br \/>\nTo <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/start_selling?utm_source=brand&amp;utm_medium=blog\">become a seller on Fiverr<\/a>, all you have to do is choose a username and fill out some basic information about your skills and expertise. You\u2019ll be able to create a profile, which will serve as your window to the Fiverr buyer community.<br \/>\nNext, you can create your first gig. This is the service that you\u2019ll sell on the Fiverr platform. It could be something along the lines of \u201cWriting a Case Study,\u201d \u201cCopyedit Your E-Book,\u201d \u201cSpellcheck Your Resume,\u201d or something else related to your field.<br \/>\nYou can create multiple gigs, too. Once you\u2019ve established yourself, you can gain recognition and earn more by becoming a Top Rated Seller or a Fiverr Pro. In fact, Fiverr Pros are considered the &#8220;Best of the Best&#8221; that Fiverr has to offer, and being accepted into this group <a href=\"https:\/\/pro.fiverr.com\/sso\/oauth?custom1=direct-link\">requires a separate application process<\/a>. If you can work your way up to becoming a Fiverr Pro, then you&#8217;re definitely considered a premium writer!<\/p>\n<h2>ClearVoice<\/h2>\n<p>Founded in 2014, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearvoice.com\/\">ClearVoice<\/a> is a content marketing platform that connects freelance writers, editors, designers, videographers, and content strategists with agencies and brands. The platform enables brands to fully outsource their content efforts, and every assignment is managed by either ClearVoice staff members or a freelance producer on the platform.<br \/>\nClearVoice freelancers produce various types of content, such as blog posts, articles, white papers, infographics, and web copy. The platform prioritizes freelancers who have experience with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.clearvoice.com\/hire-freelancers\/\">particular verticals<\/a>, such as business, finance, and healthcare, but they\u2019ve added tons of other categories recently.<br \/>\nClearVoice vets every freelancer who applies to be a part of their network. But your first step is to create a CV (curriculum vitae), which you can do for free without any vetting. You can use your CV like a portfolio or a personal website with no strings attached.<br \/>\nIf you decide to apply to ClearVoice\u2019s network, you\u2019ll need to fulfill some basic requirements on your CV. Once your CV is considered complete, just hit the \u201cApply\u201d button, and someone at ClearVoice will review your work.<br \/>\nIf they like what they see, you\u2019ll be added to the network, and you\u2019ll start being matched with opportunities.<\/p>\n<h2>LinkedIn<\/h2>\n<p>Being a freelance writer means being your own business, and there\u2019s no better place for business than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/\">LinkedIn<\/a>. While most professionals use the platform to network and build a resume, you can also use it as a tool for finding freelance work.<br \/>\nYour first step should be to build out your profile. You\u2019ll need a professional headshot, a headline, a summary, links to your published work, and descriptions about any relevant work experience.<br \/>\nLinkedin has also added a feature that allows you to sell services through the platform. You can do so wright in your profile summary. You can also adjust your settings to show recruiters that you\u2019re open to job opportunities.<br \/>\nOnce your profile is complete, get active on LinkedIn. Share links to your most recent work, respond to other people\u2019s posts and publish your own LinkedIn articles.<br \/>\nTo find work on LinkedIn faster, connect with people who need your skills. Ask other people in your network for referrals and respond quickly to anyone who inquires. You can even search for freelance work using LinkedIn\u2019s search bar or browse the LinkedIn jobs board for freelance gigs.<\/p>\n<h2>Freelance Writing Jobs<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/freelancewritinggigs.com\/\">Freelance Writing Jobs<\/a> was started by freelance writer Deb Ng, originally as a blog and a job posting site. Since then, it\u2019s grown into one of the most popular websites for finding freelance writing work.<br \/>\nThe <a href=\"https:\/\/freelancewritinggigs.com\/freelance-writing-job-ads\/\">job board<\/a> on Freelance Writing Jobs gets updated almost daily with new opportunities. You can search for jobs by keyword and location, and you can sort them based on time requirements.<br \/>\nTo apply for a job, simply click on the ad and follow the guidelines provided by the client. Some clients prefer you to fill out an external application form. If not, the website will provide an application form at the bottom of the job listing.<\/p>\n<h2>Kolabtree<\/h2>\n<p>When most people think of freelancers, they probably think of writers, designers, coders, or consultants. Founded in 2015, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.kolabtree.com\/\">Kolabtree<\/a> is a freelancing platform unlike any other \u2014 it\u2019s designed specifically to connect organizations with freelance scientists and researchers from around the world. However, if you have a knack for medical writing and research, this is definitely the platform for you.<br \/>\nKolabtree has a high bar of entry compared to other platforms. They only accept \u201cPhD-qualified experts.\u201d But if you\u2019re a scientist or researcher looking to get your name out there or make some extra money on the side, there\u2019s no better place to look for freelance writing work.<\/p>\n<h2>Craigslist<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.craigslist.org\/\">Craigslist<\/a> gets a bad rap. It\u2019s more-or-less unmoderated, so almost anyone can post an ad for a job on there. Although Craigslist has taken some steps to make the site more secure, you must be careful about information you share on the platform.<br \/>\nThat said, there are still plenty of freelance writing opportunities. Craigslist sorts its job categories based on the type of freelancing expertise required, such as writing\/editing, so it\u2019s easy to find opportunities that match your skills.<br \/>\nSome of the jobs you find on Craigslist may even be better paying than the ones you find on other platforms. If you find a client who is a good fit, you could even build a long-term partnership with them.<br \/>\nWhen applying for jobs on Craigslist, prioritize ads that include a company name or website. If these aren\u2019t present, you should verify who posted the ad before you provide them with any sensitive information. A good ad should have plenty of details about what type of freelancer they\u2019re looking for, what expertise they need, and what volume of work they\u2019re prepared to throw your way.<br \/>\nFinally, don\u2019t hesitate to ask about pay if they don\u2019t list it in the ad. There\u2019s no reason to sell yourself short when there are so many other opportunities available.<\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Wait for Freelance Work to Come to You<\/h2>\n<p>The key to being a successful freelancer is often hustling to find your next assignment, but it doesn\u2019t have to be a chore. The sites listed here can make it easier for you to find work quickly.<\/p>\n<p>After all, you don\u2019t get paid to look for freelance work; you get paid to do freelance work, so get out there and start searching!<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, you can save even more time on invoicing, expense tracking, drafting contracts, and writing proposals with AND.CO&#8217;s complete suite of freelancing tools.<a href=\"https:\/\/app.and.co\/signup\">\u00a0Join AND.CO right now for free<\/a> to spend more time doing paid work and less time doing administrative tasks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Maybe you\u2019ve just entered the world of freelancing, or maybe you\u2019re looking for your next big client.
