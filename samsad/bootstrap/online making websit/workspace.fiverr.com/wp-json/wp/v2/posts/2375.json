Having the freedom to work remotely means you can work from anywhere\u2026 and we mean ANYWHERE! The thought of packing up your stapler and setting sail\u00a0might seem daunting at first, but once you see what these beautiful cities have to offer, you\u2019ll be knee deep in travel size shampoos and booking flights like a Wall Street floor trader circa 1988. For a glimpse of the lifestyle, check out blogs like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.locationrebel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Location Rebel<\/a> or the <a href=\"https:\/\/reddit.com\/r\/digitalnomad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Digital Nomad<\/a> community over at Reddit.<br \/>\nFor now, check out some of the best locations you can work from according to the folks at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/nomadlist.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nomad List<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Bangkok, Thailand<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Despite what Leonardo DiCaprio says\u00a0in his movie <em>The Beach<\/em>, Thailand has more to offer than just secluded coves and hidden cults led by Tilda Swinton. With a Nomad Score of 8\/10, it\u2019s easy to see why Bangkok is becoming a hub for digital nomads and the self-employed. Whether it\u2019s in one of their numerous internet cafes and co-working spaces, or through one of the city\u2019s 23,000 free public wifi hotspots, this capital city has your wifi needs covered. According to Nomad List, the cost of living in Bangkok is roughly $1056\/month, which means you can spend more money on getting daily Thai massages at $7-$18 a pop.<\/p>\n<p>After a long day hunched over your laptop in\u00a0your cute little apartment near the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tripadvisor.com\/Attraction_Review-g293916-d450971-Reviews-Chatuchak_Weekend_Market-Bangkok.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chatuchak market<\/a>, a quick deep tissue massage will\u00a0give your shoulders a rest and your mind a break! Bangkok also scores highly within the LGBTQ community, and is considered friendly to women. Startups are welcome and nurtured in the city, making it an easy choice for entrepreneurs and digital nomads to flock South and set up shop amongst the Bodhi trees. Companies such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bangkok-entrepreneurs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bangkok Entrepreneurs<\/a> are helping to cultivate new talents and encourage the next generation to bring their\u00a0business to the city.<\/p>\n<p>The weather in Bangkok is somewhat \u2018toasty\u2019, with an average annual temperature ranging from\u00a079 to 87 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the fact that the humidity will make you feel like you\u2019re being covered in a warm, wet blanket, the A\/C around the city is second to none. You\u2019ll have to embrace the\u00a0frizzy hair styles you\u2019ve been suppressing since you were 8 years old, but at least you\u2019ll be in one of the most vibrant cities in the world!<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Seoul, South Korea<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>South Korea\u2019s spicy neighbor to the North might deter you from considering the South as a forever-home, but we strongly urge you to take a deeper look at what this beautiful country has to offer. According to\u00a0Nomad List, Seoul is considered a very safe city, as well as friendly to women! And as we all know, women are just as bad-ass as men in the freelancing world, so well done Seoul for recognizing that! If you\u2019re tired of paying extortionate monthly rates for your local co-working offices, you\u2019ll love spots like Venture Space and Peachtree, both of which offer monthly memberships for under $91\/month.<\/p>\n<p>The popular ride-sharing service, Uber, is active in Seoul, so if you don\u2019t feel like getting behind the wheel on unfamiliar streets, you can hire\u00a0a friendly neighborhood Uber driver to ferry you between client meetings and cappuccinos! No matter where you live in the world, everyone can agree that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. Seoul has a great nightlife and top notch craft beer houses.<\/p>\n<p>You can finish up those monthly budget reports and head out for a pint of craft brew\u00a0at popular watering holes\u00a0like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.timeout.com\/seoul\/bars\/hidden-track\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hidden Track<\/a> bar in Dongdaemun-gu. Just remember that as a major city, Seoul does offer many pricier options that some of the other cities on here won&#8217;t. Keep your eye on price tags until you get a lay of your new land.<br \/>\nWith that all in mind, you\u2019ll be the life and <i>Seoul<\/i> of the party! (Too much?)<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Las Palmas, Spain<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>If you live in a city that\u2019s on an island owned by Spain, and located a few miles off the coast of Morroco, your life is probably going to be pretty awesome! So it\u2019s no surprise that Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, is listed as one of the funnest, safest, and peaceful cities for a digital nomad. The sunny weather, the fresh fish, and the vibrant music, have earned Las Palmas a Nomad List\u00a0rating of 8.3\/10.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of being self-employed is that you can be yourself. For members of the LGBTQ community, or from minority ethnic groups, you can rest assured that you\u2019ll be made to feel welcome and safe in Las Palmas. The city has a good public wifi system, as well as numerous internet cafes and co-working spaces. Island life might seem disconnected at first, but with collaborative office spaces like The House, offering memberships from just $105\/month, you\u2019ll be connected to the rest of the world faster than you can say \u2018otro cafe por favor!\u2019 As an extra bonus, if you\u2019re trying to escape the dreadful L.A. traffic, or the Evil Kanevil drivers of New York, you can breathe easy knowing that Las Palmas has a great &#8216;traffic safety&#8217; rating, as well as beautiful beaches at every turn to avoid the jams.<\/p>\n<p>Freedom of speech is crucial for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and pretty much anyone in the creative industry, so it\u2019s a relief to see that this island allows you to speak your mind. After you\u2019ve finished exercising your right to free speech, you can head to one of their swanky clubs like As an extra bonus, if you\u2019re trying to escape the dreadful L.A. traffic, or the Evil Kanevil drivers of New York, you can breathe easy knowing that Las Palmas has a great traffic safety rating, as well as beautiful beaches at every turn\u00a0to avoid the jams.

The\u00a0Nirvana Bali Golf Course\u00a0is roughly\u00a020 minutes north\u00a0in Tanah Lot, so for those of you can work remotely but still like to close deals on a golf course, you can do so nearby. It\u2019s win\/win.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Taipei, Taiwan<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>Not everything is made in Taiwan, but you can sure as hell make a living there. Taipei has far more to offer then just those little stickers you find on the bottom of rubber ducks and candle holders. According to Nomad List, the city is friendly to women, foreigners, and the LGBTQ community. For all of those digital nomads looking for a fun, vibrant change, Taipei might be the answer. Working from an entirely different country is the ultimate in \u2018working remotely\u2019, which is why Taipei\u2019s great public wifi system and vast collection of co-working spaces has made it an attractive draw for digital nomads over recent years.<\/p>\n<p>The According to Nomad List, the city is friendly to women, foreigners, and the LGBTQ community.
