Get to know your clients<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting to know your clients on a more personal level can build a unique working relationship that\u2019s hard to replace. We\u2019re not saying you should follow your clients on social media and have beers on the weekend, but try to establish a personal rapport and get to know them outside of what they do for work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s been said that<a href=\"https:\/\/www.superoffice.com\/blog\/customer-retention-tips-with-crm-software\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" the number one reason customers leave a company is because they feel like it doesn\u2019t care about them (opens in a new tab)\"> the number one reason customers leave a company is because they feel like it doesn\u2019t care about them<\/a>. Your clients will be no different &#8211; show an interest in them and you\u2019ll be valued. A good idea is to create a CRM spreadsheet with each of your clients information &#8211; here you can note down anything they\u2019ve mentioned to you, from kids\u2019 names to family holidays and pets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From time to time, ask about your clients\u2019 personal interests, family, and hobbies in the end of an email.It will help build that personal connection and establish yourself as a valuable asset.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2. Send \u2018magic\u2019 follow-up emails<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may not have heard from a client in awhile, but that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t any work to be done. To help with customer retention, and potentially bring in extra work, send regular follow-up emails to your clients offering to help. Freelance designer, Paul Jarvis (who works with companies like Microsoft, Yahoo &amp; Warner Music), explains this concept in the<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/paul-jarvis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\" Retaining Clients &amp; Building Profitable Work Relationships episode of our six-figure freelancer course (opens in a new tab)\"> Retaining Clients &amp; Building Profitable Work Relationships episode of our six-figure freelancer course<\/a>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t heard from a client in a few months, in the beginning I used to think, &#8216;Okay&#8230; If they&#8217;re not contacting me, they don&#8217;t need anything from me&#8217;. And I was wrong, because when I started to contact them and just say, &#8216;Hey, how&#8217;s your business going and is there anything I can help you with?&#8217;, most of the time they&#8217;d be like &#8216;Oh yeah, there was actually something that you could do&#8217;.<\/em><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>If you created a CRM spreadsheet to help you get to know your clients better, add a column where you can note down your correspondence. If you haven\u2019t contacted a client in awhile, send them a short follow-up email asking how their business is going and if you can help with anything. According to Paul, \u201cIt\u2019s just like once a month, maybe 20-30 minutes and boom, I\u2019ve got a full deck for that month from that\u201d. Definitely sounds a lot more worthwhile than painstakingly searching for new clients\u2026&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>3. Anticipate issues before they happen<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since client retention is all about stopping clients from leaving, you need to be able to anticipate issues and address them before they happen. Look out for warning signals that a client is dissatisfied, unhappy, or acting out of the ordinary. If a client didn\u2019t like the last piece you did for them, offer a discount to entice them into working with you again before they decide to look elsewhere. If you\u2019ve sent a client work and haven\u2019t yet received feedback, give them a call and ask if everything is OK before they tell you that it\u2019s not.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking up on potential issues and addressing them yourself &#8211; rather than waiting for the client &#8211; can soften the blow and help mend relationships before the client decides to leave.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>4. Create a \u2018services menu\u2019<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is another Paul Jarvis piece of wisdom from our<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/paul-jarvis\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/six-figure-freelancer\/paul-jarvis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"six-figure freelance audio course (opens in a new tab)\">six-figure freelance audio course<\/a>. &#8220;I&#8217;m always very clear with people exactly the type of work that I do. Even in the &#8216;getting started guide&#8217; that I used to send clients&#8230; [I would say], these are the things that you can hire me to do. These are the related things that you cannot hire me to do, because I do not do these things&#8221;. How can creating a services menu help with customer retention? Well, it\u2019s a winning strategy for a number of reasons:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; Clients won\u2019t ask you to do work you can\u2019t do. Rejecting work can sometimes cause a client relationship to suffer &#8211; even if it\u2019s something you\u2019re unfamiliar with. Having a clear outline from the get-go firmly establishes what you can do and helps to stop you from rejecting jobs;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Having all of your available services up on a \u2018menu\u2019 means that you\u2019re able to advertise extra skill sets that perhaps the client didn\u2019t know you could do. If you offer multiple services, make sure every client is aware of it. You\u2019ll more than likely be hired to do more than one task;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; If you\u2019re able to build a network with other freelancers, the menu of \u2018things you <em>can\u2019t do<\/em> can become a lead magnet for your network and vice versa. When clients ask you to do something you can\u2019t do, you can refer them to another freelancer. On the other hand, should another freelancer be asked to do a job that they can\u2019t do but you can, they can refer you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your client relationships alive and nurture them well &#8211; you will thrive as a freelancer in return.<br><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you don\u2019t already have a client retention strategy in place, we\u2019ve got 4 keys
