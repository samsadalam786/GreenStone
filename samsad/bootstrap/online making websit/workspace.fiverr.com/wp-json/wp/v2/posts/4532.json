These five techniques will help you find more work much sooner than you think.<\/p>\n<h3>Scan job postings for full-time gigs that line up with your experience.<\/h3>\n<p>Career networking websites like LinkedIn can help you find more freelance work. Do LinkedIn research to find out who the hiring manager of the full-time gig is, and send a personalized note explaining why a consultant might be able to fit the role.<br \/>\nPro-tip: It\u2019s relatively easy to guess at or look up the standard email conventions at most major companies. There are even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voilanorbert.com\/verify\/\">email verification sites<\/a> that will tell you if the email is active before you hit send.<br \/>\nHowever, depending on workload and company, hiring a consultant could be an easy sell in terms of overall cost. On the other hand, the worst case scenario would be that they still have your contact information for any opportunities in the future.<br \/>\nOne pro-tip: set up automated alerts and sign up for curated lists so you don\u2019t have to do as much time digging around the boards. These sites are convenient and simple, and you\u2019ll be receiving opportunities for freelance work in your email each day.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-intuitive-ways-finding-freelance-work-probably-arent%2F&#038;text=Looking%20for%20%23freelancework%3F%20Set%20up%20automated%20alerts%20and%20sign%20up%20for%20curated%20lists.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Looking for #freelancework?

If you\u2019re looking to take on new clients, put an ask out to your network and update your headline.<br \/>\nPotential clients aren\u2019t mind readers, so the more you promote that you\u2019re available then, the greater your chances are of having someone forwarding your info to someone who could use your freelance work.<\/p>\n<h3>Maintain a wish list.<\/h3>\n<p>Create a spreadsheet of \u201cdream clients.\u201d Maybe these are the people you see in the news doing cool things. Or maybe they\u2019re interesting individuals in your space that you\u2019d like to work with.<br \/>\nOnce you have this list, spend time each month catching up on what they\u2019re doing. If you\u2019re an SEO strategist or UX designer, peek at their websites to see if they are lacking anything you offer. Use LinkedIn research and <a href=\"https:\/\/email-checker.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free email verification tools<\/a> online to find and save their emails.<br \/>\nFrom there, you can reach out to the relevant hiring managers. Make sure outreach is always one-to-one and personal. Although mass emails seem faster and easier, sending a mass email is actually unhelpful. It hurts your chances of building a relationship down the road and is less likely to elicit a response.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-intuitive-ways-finding-freelance-work-probably-arent%2F&#038;text=%23Jobsearch%20pro%20tip%3A%20make%20sure%20outreach%20is%20always%20one-to-one%20and%20personal.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#Jobsearch pro tip: make sure outreach is always one-to-one and personal.  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-intuitive-ways-finding-freelance-work-probably-arent%2F&#038;text=%23Jobsearch%20pro%20tip%3A%20make%20sure%20outreach%20is%20always%20one-to-one%20and%20personal.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Go to the source.<\/h3>\n<p>Any type of company that \u201cholds\u201d a portfolio of other companies is a great place to start your search for freelance work.<br \/>\nFor example, if you are a programmer specializing in iOS apps, you can find venture capitalists or incubators who manage these types of portfolios.
