This<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-write-great-proposals-that-win-you-more-freelance-projects\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">handy checklist<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help you get the content on point.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But there\u2019s more to a proposal than just the content. It has to look good, too. After all, we live in an aesthetic world. <\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t dress up for the occasion, you\u2019re unlikely to make it past the first date.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design is what frames the content and supports the message. The two should work seamlessly together, like two peas in a pod. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a proposal ticks all the boxes, you\u2019ll be well on your way to securing that gig.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s a no brainer that attractive content gets more attention, but how do you achieve this? <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips to help start your winning proposal. <\/span><br \/>\n<i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top tip: We\u2019ve built\u00a0<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposals<\/span><\/i><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> straight into the Fiverr Workspace app and make it super easy and intuitive to create them\u2014for free.

Use a simple template<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design of your proposal is important, but it shouldn&#8217;t detract from the content.\u00a0Clients will want to get straight to the detail of the proposal, and you can help this process by using a clean and sleek design.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A simply-designed template will signal quality and help you present your brand as professional. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can help your proposal stand out from the rest with a few added features. E<\/span>-signing and file attachments can make you look infinitely more experienced, not to mention make things simple for your client to speed up the process of getting a signature.<\/p>\n<h2><b>2. Customize to your brand<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A template provides a great skeleton for your project proposal but now is your chance to fill it out with your individual touch. Your brand is more than just a name &#8211; it\u2019s your whole identity as a business and it&#8217;s represented through aesthetics, graphics and tone of voice.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Add your own branding, logo, images and custom slides that sell you and your work to create a seriously compelling proposal.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a color palette that works well with your brand color scheme to make you more memorable. Adding color to background highlights, text headings, bullet points and tables is a quick and easy way to represent the consistency for your brand.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. Use a visually appealing, structured layout<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spent all your time working on the content but didn\u2019t worry about the layout? Think again. It\u2019s vital to make your first impression count.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A well-organized structure could begin with the title, summary and statement of the problem\/issue and continue onto approach, methodology, cost and benefits.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also use photography, graphics, or screenshots to help enhance your layout and bring your proposal to life.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. Retain their attention with the right formatting<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing less appealing than a block of unformatted text. If you want to get your client\u2019s attention, space out your information in a way that\u2019s simple to digest and easy to scan. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No one likes to read long, drawn-out sentences in clunky paragraphs, featuring a fancy font that blends into the background. Stick to short paragraphs, and use sub-headers, bullet points and indentations where you can.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose a font that is easy to read and stands out from the background. Make sure the proposal is also suitable for printing.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What&#8217;s next?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiverr Workspace\u2019s free <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/proposals\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">proposal software<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will help you create a professional-looking proposal in minutes.
