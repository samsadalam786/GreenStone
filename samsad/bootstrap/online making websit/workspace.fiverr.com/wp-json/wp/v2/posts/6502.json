And we&#8217;re using my real cold email templates, case study examples, and screenshots of the actual cold emails that generated &nbsp;$110,500+ in 2018 for my freelance business. You can grab those free templates <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/cold-email\/\">right here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to tell you there&#8217;s an easy-to-follow, clear copy and paste formula for writing a cold email that <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/a-complete-guide-to-becoming-a-freelancer\/\">grows your freelance business<\/a> every single time, the reality just isn&#8217;t that simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s helpful if you&#8217;re starting with a cold email template and pitching process that&#8217;s been perfected over five years and through hundreds of freelance pitches in the real world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I&#8217;m going to show you real emails that have led to life-changing deals for my freelance content marketing business (and helped me launch into freelancing full-time in 2016).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfecting my cold outreach process has done a lot for my freelance business\u2014which is primarily based around writing and promoting high quality blog content for my clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>One of the cold emails we&#8217;re examining converted into a $52,500 deal for 2 posts per month, that\u2019s continued for nearly two years now.<\/li><li>Another has translated into a $17,500 contract for 7 blog posts so far.<\/li><li>And the last one we&#8217;re diving into landed me a $10,000\/mo retainer contract for 4 posts per month.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These cold emails we&#8217;re looking at today generated a total of $110,500 in the last year.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This process for writing cold emails has generated multiple six-figure <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\">freelance contracts<\/a> and high-value gigs for me with companies like LinkedIn, Zendesk, Quickbooks, Adobe, Vistaprint, Close and more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the truth about freelancing though: <strong>Success is never guaranteed.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can&#8217;t compare where you are in your freelancing journey today with where others are right now.

Yet still, there will be other times when you&#8217;re tempted to take anything that comes your way\u2014or you&#8217;re spending most of your days doing outreach to drum up new projects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my experience, it takes a lot of hard work and hustle to hit the six-figure mark as a freelancer. Especially if you&#8217;re risk averse like me\u2014and want to get there <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/why-freelance-while-working-full-time-and-how-to-do-it\/\">before you quit your day job<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not careful, it&#8217;s easy to slip into a cycle of <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/7-habits-of-highly-effective-freelancers\/\">feast or famine<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you do great work for your clients, start getting referrals and build a brand for yourself within your niche, you&#8217;ll be able to step further and further away from spending large blocks of time regularly cold emailing and pitching new clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Good clients and solid projects will begin coming to you. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, let&#8217;s talk about cold emailing and dig into the templates I&#8217;ve battle-tested and tweaked for years.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>5 Steps to Write Cold Emails That Convert<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not even the best cold email will get you a response if you&#8217;re pitching the wrong type of client or a point of contact who&#8217;s not empowered to take action on hiring you.

Identify the Right Clients<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the majority of your experience is in writing about finance or real estate, it doesn&#8217;t make much sense for you to pitch a company in the healthcare space on your freelance writing services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same thing goes for designers. If your style favors flat design and retro color schemes, you&#8217;re probably not going to enjoy working with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcodesign.com\/3066401\/the-best-and-worst-branding-of-2016\">stuffy, well-established brands<\/a> that have no plans to move their branding into the 21st century.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choose only to approach clients that you could picture yourself working with.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t resonate with their brand, style and tone, leave it be. You&#8217;ll be able to deliver better work elsewhere. And they&#8217;ll also benefit more from hiring someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as important as picking the right client for you to pitch, is making sure that you&#8217;re also right for them. Not enough freelancers think about this.<\/p>\n\n\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-steps-to-write-cold-emails-that-convert-freelance-clients%2F&#038;text=As%20a%20%23freelancer%2C%20making%20sure%20you%27re%20right%20for%20the%20client%20is%20just%20as%20important%20as%20making%20sure%20they%27re%20right%20for%20you.%20-%20%40theryanrobinson&#038;related' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">As a #freelancer, making sure you&#039;re right for the client is just as important as making sure they&#039;re right for you. &#8211; @theryanrobinson <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F5-steps-to-write-cold-emails-that-convert-freelance-clients%2F&#038;text=As%20a%20%23freelancer%2C%20making%20sure%20you%27re%20right%20for%20the%20client%20is%20just%20as%20important%20as%20making%20sure%20they%27re%20right%20for%20you.%20-%20%40theryanrobinson&#038;related' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span>\n\n\n<p>Answer these questions when considering a prospect to make sure this is the right client for you (and that you&#8217;ll be good for them):<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What makes you uniquely qualified to help this particular client?<\/li><li>Have you done similar work in the past?<\/li><li>Does the prospect of working with this client excite you, or it purely a financial decision?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For my content marketing business, I very thoughtfully brand myself in a way that makes me appealing to a certain type of client.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not a marketing consultant to just anyone that&#8217;ll hire me. I&#8217;ve leaned into my experience over the years, developed my own marketing tactics and have come up with a very specific set of clients I&#8217;m uniquely qualified to help\u2014where my services get supercharged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s meant branding myself specifically as a content marketing consultant, a small niche within the broader marketing world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, I work only with business experts and growing startups where I&#8217;ll be able to write about topics related to business, freelancing, productivity and entrepreneurship (what I already do and my original motivation for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/how-start-blog\/\">starting a blog<\/a>).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"750\" height=\"334\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-Freelancers-Pick-Niche.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9791\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-Freelancers-Pick-Niche.jpg 750w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-Freelancers-Pick-Niche-300x134.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>I also clearly highlight clients I&#8217;ve worked with\u2014Tech startups in San Francisco\u2014to encourage more of the same to want to work with me.

She&#8217;s got a broad range of experience running marketing campaigns, knows how to use Adobe Photoshop &amp; Illustrator, has made a few logos over the years and does the design work for her personal website\u2014mostly for fun, but you like her style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancer #2 is a specialist (with a clear niche). He works for himself as a full-time graphic designer and has done branding work for several coffee shops over the years. You like his style just as much, and can tell that he&#8217;s got a lot of experience doing exactly the kind of work you need done too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which freelancer would you choose?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every day of the week, I&#8217;d take freelancer #2. The specialist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll also <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/raising-your-freelance-rates-in-2019-heres-how-to-do-it-right\/\">pay them significantly more<\/a>\u2014because I know I&#8217;m tapping into expertise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In your freelance business, you want to brand yourself as that expert with a niche. Make yourself the obvious choice. That&#8217;s step one for making sure your cold emails get answered.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, you&#8217;re ready to start searching for freelance clients. Start with the people you know first. As much as I love cold emails, warm introductions are significantly more effective, so begin there.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look first to these groups of people within your network to determine if there are any freelance opportunities to work with those who already know your work ethic, are personally invested in their relationship with you and want to see you succeed:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Friends (and their friends)<\/li><li>Family (and their friends)<\/li><li>Previous co-workers who now work elsewhere<\/li><li>Classmates from school<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of the exact role your connection has within the company they\u2019re at, if that company could be a good fit for you to pitch on freelance work\u2014that&#8217;s a great opportunity to chase down.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick up the phone to catch up, grab coffee and ask if they&#8217;d be willing to introduce you to the right person within their organization for chatting about helping out on a freelance basis.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, walk away from these conversations with the name for who you should be reaching out to\u2014then you can work your cold email magic.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continue updating the status of your outreach efforts using either <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/crm-spreadsheet-template\/\">a spreadsheet<\/a> or an easy-to-use CRM like <a href=\"https:\/\/close.com\/\">Close<\/a> that gives helpful reminders and reporting, so you&#8217;re able to see how well your cold outreach performs over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Find Your Ideal Point of Contact<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I&#8217;m trying to land a new client, I don&#8217;t want to spend time convincing a gatekeeper on the company&#8217;s HR or recruiting team that I&#8217;d be the best for the job\u2014I&#8217;m going straight to the person who&#8217;s going to be in control of the hiring decision.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the HR gatekeepers probably have criteria they know to look for, but that leaves too much up to chance.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to cold email pitch someone who speaks my language.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a content marketer (or<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/freelance-writing-client\/\"> freelance writer<\/a>), my ideal point of contact at a potential client company usually has one of these job titles:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Director of Content Marketing<\/li><li>Content Marketing Lead<\/li><li>Senior Content Marketing Manager<\/li><li>Director of Marketing<\/li><li>Blog Manager\/Editor<\/li><li>VP of Content Marketing<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to go for a manager-level point of contact. The type of person who will have a say in hiring contractors for your discipline.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a freelance designer, you&#8217;ll probably be looking to connect with a creative director.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a freelance developer, your ideal point of contact will likely be a director of engineering.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, if you can&#8217;t find a manager point of contact, making an initial (genuine) connection with someone who&#8217;s a staff writer\u2014or designer, engineer\u2014can lead to an introduction up the chain to their manager if you&#8217;re able to provide a significant amount of value in your cold email outreach.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s important is that you skip the application, and go for connecting directly with real people.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use LinkedIn to find your ideal point of contact.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Open up a new tab and head over to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/\">LinkedIn<\/a>.<br><\/li><li>In the main search bar, type in the title of the position you want to connect with\u2014choose to display results for people with that job title or skill.<\/li><li>Filter those results by people only with that job or skill at the company you&#8217;re targeting, by typing in that company&#8217;s name within the current company field. Now, your results will be hyper-specific.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to land <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trello.com\/\">Trello<\/a> as a content marketing client, my search would look like this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"584\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-for-Freelancers-Finding-Client-on-LinkedIn-copy.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9769\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-for-Freelancers-Finding-Client-on-LinkedIn-copy.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-for-Freelancers-Finding-Client-on-LinkedIn-copy-300x175.jpg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/How-to-Write-Cold-Email-for-Freelancers-Finding-Client-on-LinkedIn-copy-768x449.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, this works best for companies within a certain size range.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they&#8217;re on the smaller side, you might not immediately find a very clear point of contact. Same goes for enterprise-size companies that have dozens of potential points of contact.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make your best guess and keep moving rather than getting hung up or spending more than 5 minutes at this stage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3.

Others I&#8217;ll need to then pitch on my content marketing services (like putting together a content marketing strategy and executing on it) if they don&#8217;t bring it up themselves.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not always a good fit for everyone I ask, but because I&#8217;ve already provided value AND essentially given them a real-time demo of what my service is through the post they&#8217;re included in, my conversion rate to paid client relationship with this method is extremely high.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This email contains no promotional links. No service pitches. No asking if they&#8217;re hiring.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to be patient at this stage. <strong>Your goal is to provide value and show your worth<\/strong>.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing that <em>first<\/em>, instead of just making promises of the value you <em>could<\/em> deliver in the future, you&#8217;re going to win their trust and catch their attention in a much different way than 99% of other freelancers cold emailing and pitching them to be hired.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems simple, but almost nobody has the patience to execute this kind of in-depth<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.close.io\/sales-strategies\"> sales strategy<\/a>. And because of that, so many freelancers waste a lot of time writing cold emails that get no response, largely because they&#8217;re being too short sighted.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure it can take weeks to turn into a paid gig\u2014and sometimes it never will\u2014but the freelancers who take my course on learning how to pitch effectively experience massively positive results from following this strategy.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the cold email that netted me a <strong>$50,000+<\/strong> deal:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cold-Email-Example-for-Freelancers-Ryan-Robinson-ryrob-feature-on-my-blog-1024x335-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"335\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cold-Email-Example-for-Freelancers-Ryan-Robinson-ryrob-feature-on-my-blog-1024x335-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9776\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cold-Email-Example-for-Freelancers-Ryan-Robinson-ryrob-feature-on-my-blog-1024x335-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cold-Email-Example-for-Freelancers-Ryan-Robinson-ryrob-feature-on-my-blog-1024x335-1-300x98.jpg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Cold-Email-Example-for-Freelancers-Ryan-Robinson-ryrob-feature-on-my-blog-1024x335-1-768x251.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After getting the quote from this startup founder and including him in<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ryrob.com\/start-business-advice\/\"> my post<\/a>, he was pumped about the thousands of shares the post had received in the first few weeks of going live (I spent $100 boosting the post on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest &amp;<a href=\"https:\/\/quuupromote.co\/\"> Quuu Promote<\/a> to get an initial share spike).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This founder wanted those kinds of results for his startup&#8217;s blog too.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He actually beat me to the pitch\u2014and emailed asking if I&#8217;d be up for working with him:<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Best-Cold-Emails-Ryan-Robinson-Screenshot-ryrob-1024x166-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"166\" src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Best-Cold-Emails-Ryan-Robinson-Screenshot-ryrob-1024x166-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9777\" srcset=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Best-Cold-Emails-Ryan-Robinson-Screenshot-ryrob-1024x166-1.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Best-Cold-Emails-Ryan-Robinson-Screenshot-ryrob-1024x166-1-300x49.jpg 300w, https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/Best-Cold-Emails-Ryan-Robinson-Screenshot-ryrob-1024x166-1-768x125.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a quick chat on the phone laying out my workflow and getting clear on his goals, we locked in a strategy for publishing 2 posts each month\u2014we&#8217;ve been working together ever since.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Cold Email Template #2: The &#8220;Referral&#8221; Warm Up<\/strong><br><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s better than sending a cold email?

Follow Up (Intelligently) on Your Cold Email<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s another hard truth about freelancing: You have to fight to get noticed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s because everyone you&#8217;re pitching is busy.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I never followed up on my cold emails (especially in the early days of freelancing), I wouldn&#8217;t stay busy. But there&#8217;s a fine line between being that annoying person who sends check-in emails every other day and allowing yourself to justify not following up simply because you haven&#8217;t heard back yet.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to strike a balance and provide value with your follow ups, don&#8217;t just ping your prospects with the same question every time you follow up.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steli Efti, founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.close.io\/follow-up\">Close<\/a> (one of the best CRMs for freelancers) is a master at following up and knows the importance of never letting a lead slip away.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He shares, &#8220;I have a simple philosophy. I follow up as many times as necessary until I get a response. I don\u2019t care what the response is as long as I get one. If someone tells me they need another 14 days to get back to me, I will put that in my calendar and ping them again in 14 days.&#8221;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about when you send your cold email and don&#8217;t hear back for a few days?<\/strong><br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow up every 3-4 business days. <br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the email is truly 100% cold and you have no connection whatsoever to your prospect, limit your follow ups to around 4-5 outreach attempts.
