And the clients you work with may be great. But until&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/the-freelancers-guide-to-getting-your-invoices-paid-faster\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">you get paid for your freelance work<\/a>, you might as well be spending your time on an interesting hobby, not running a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you have a happy or complicated relationship with money as a freelancer, one thing remains true:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You\u2019re not in business until your invoices get paid.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in today\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Pro Freelancer Fundamentals<\/em>&nbsp;article, we\u2019ll tackle two critical elements of getting paid as a freelancer:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Invoice clarity&nbsp;<\/strong>and<\/li><li><strong>Invoice consistency<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can master these two elements\u2014clarity and consistency\u2014you\u2019ll eliminate 99% of the reasons&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/what-to-do-when-you-are-not-get-paid-for-a-freelance-job\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your invoices are not getting paid on time<\/a>&nbsp;(or at all).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why Clarity &amp; Consistency?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into the \u201chow\u201d of clear and consistent invoices, it seems worth taking a moment to answer this question:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\u201cWhy do my invoices have to be clear and consistent?\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning is simple. Your invoicing habits&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/what-these-5-invoicing-habits-say-about-you-as-a-freelancer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">say A LOT about you<\/a>&nbsp;as a freelancer. How and when you invoice your clients speaks volumes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re clear and consistent in your invoicing, your clients will know you mean business and take paying you much more seriously.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re unclear or lazy when it comes to sending or collecting invoices, your clients will also be lazy when it comes to paying you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s never good.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take it from me: putting in a small amount of extra effort up front will pay off massively as you\u00a0grow your freelance business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Invoice Clarity = Quick Payment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start off by talking about your invoice clarity. When I say \u201cclarity\u201d I\u2019m referring to ensuring your client can quickly and easily see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Who the invoice is from<\/li><li>What the invoice is for<\/li><li>How much they owe you<\/li><li>Where, when, and how to pay<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this all becomes automatic and easy when\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/free-invoice-generator.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using our free invoice generator<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">our invoicing app within the Fiverr Workspace Suite<\/a>, which will generate a professional, clean invoice automatically once your client accepts your proposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s break down each of these with a little more detail.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clarifying who the invoice is from<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the word INVOICE in large letters at the top of the page. Including your company name, personal name, logo, and contact information is among the most important aspects of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/guide\/creating-sending-invoices.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">creating an invoice as a freelancer<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure you use the same business name or personal information your client is used to working with and the same information the accounting department is likely to have in their system in order to avoid delays in getting paid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If at any point, you have to change your name or any contact information, notify your client before sending an invoice with that new information in order to clarify the invoicing process as much as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clarifying what the invoice is for<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, your invoice is likely to get paid much more quickly when the client knows exactly what they\u2019re paying for.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll avoid emails like: \u201cremind me what invoice #1234 was for again?\u201d which are just another pit stop on the way to getting paid for your freelance work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you charge by the hour, consider using&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AND.CO\u2019s time-tracking<\/a>&nbsp;capabilities to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/faq.and.co\/en\/articles\/2200635-how-can-i-invoice-time-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">add time-based line items directly to your invoice<\/a>. There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-save-time-and-make-more-money-with-a-freelance-time-tracker\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lots of reasons to be using a time-tracker<\/a>, but adding clarity to your invoice is definitely at the top of the list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clarifying how much they owe you<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem obvious, but if the client doesn\u2019t immediately know how much to send you, your invoice payment could get&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/7-reasons-your-clients-dont-pay-on-time-and-how-to-fix-it\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significantly delayed<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to include all relevant price information clearly on your invoice. If you&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/free-invoice-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">use AND.CO\u2019s invoice templates<\/a>, you\u2019ll always have a place to include relevant cost information including:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Line Item Costs<\/li><li>Subtotal<\/li><li>Discounts<\/li><li>Additional Fees or Taxes<\/li><li>Total Due<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the goal is to give your client as much clarity and information as possible in order to expedite and guarantee your payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clarifying where and how to pay<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s critical to remove any confusion or roadblocks around where, how, and when to pay your invoice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re sending a PDF invoice&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/7-tips-sending-perfect-invoice\">via email<\/a>, make sure to include a clickable link where your client can enter their payment information and send a payment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even better, we recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-use-invoice-automation-to-take-the-pressure-off-invoicing\/\">using an invoicing app<\/a>&nbsp;like the one in the AND.CO suite to take the pressure off getting your invoices perfect every time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create an AND.CO invoice in around 20 seconds. And easy, secure payments are directly embedded which means you can accept credit cards and ACH payments online right from your invoices without an extra step.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Clarity: Next Steps<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, of course, lots of other factors to consider when it comes to making your invoices extremely clear.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design, font choice, file type, email subject line, language, and lots more play a role in making your invoice as clear as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you focus on the ideas suggested in this section, your clients will be as clear as possible on who to pay, when to pay, and how to pay and you\u2019ll see your invoice payments come in consistently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that you don\u2019t, you may have some work to do when it comes to consistency in your invoicing. We\u2019ll tackle that next.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Invoice Consistency = Full Payment<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to being as clear as possible about your invoice and the details therein, one of the most critical elements of&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/getting-paid-as-a-freelancer\">getting paid as a freelancer<\/a>&nbsp;comes with consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency not only shows you\u2019re a professional but also shows you\u2019re serious about collecting payment for the work you\u2019ve completed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few key ways to improve your invoice consistency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Consistently following up&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, it\u2019s critical you\u2019re consistent when following up with a client who hasn\u2019t paid your invoice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.iko-system.com\/blog\/sales-emails\/sales-email-stats-what-are-the-response-rates-in-the-uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one study<\/a>, researchers found follow-up emails get an even better response than original emails: an 18% response to email #1, 13% to email #4, and 27% to email #6.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moral of this study: be consistent in your follow-up.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/clearvoice-media\/asg_XXxyOxWgX5r8UDQM%2Fart_0Y3oaInje722gVFt%2F1621284591510-1621284591510.png\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019ve built automatic reminders (for you AND your client) into&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">our invoicing tool<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ll let you know if a client is late in paying their bill and we\u2019ll remind them of their duty to pay. Easily receive alerts on your desktop, device, or even through Slack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Keeping invoice design\/layout consistent<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a long-term client who regularly processes your invoices, you should maintain consistency in how each invoice looks.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep critical information (covered in the \u201cclarity\u201d section previously) in the same place on the invoice each time you send it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make consistent design easy by&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">using our invoicing tool<\/a>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/free-invoice-templates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">these free invoice templates<\/a>&nbsp;instead of re-creating an invoice in spreadsheet software or page design app every single time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Maintaining consistent communication &amp; organization<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s critical you\u2019re consistent in the way you communicate your invoices and organize them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keep your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/invoice-number\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">invoice numbers<\/a>&nbsp;consistent.<\/li><li>Always send invoices the same way (email, in-app, messenger, etc.)<\/li><li>Consistently include any information your client needs in order to pay you.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Consistency: Next Steps<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Consistency doesn\u2019t have to be hard. Running your business in a consistent manner is as important (or maybe more important) than the actual service you provide to your clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know time can easily get away from you as a freelancer making it hard to send follow-up emails on unpaid invoices or draft up invoices in the first place.
