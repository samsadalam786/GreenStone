These include easy access to benefits, a steady paycheck, and leftover bagels in the conference room. But as they say, the grass is always greener, and a 9-to-5er wishes they had a magic wand to whip up our freelance perks, especially when it comes to solving problems. Without further ado, here is a list of freelance solutions 9-to-5ers wish they could use.<\/p>\n<h2>If You Don&#8217;t Like Where You Are, Make A Change&#8230;Literally<\/h2>\n<p>My biggest pet peeve when I worked 9-to-5 was feeling trapped in my office. It was a cave I was regulated to that I did not pick. I used to walk around with a blanket-like- shawl and my shoes off, pacing and unable to leave. The space became a distraction instead of a place of productivity as I would count down the moments until I could jet out of there. But as a freelancer, I can change my location as I see fit. This is a freelance solution many 9-to-5ers don&#8217;t have access to. They cannot just change their space if they&#8217;re feeling unproductive, they are stuck where they are both physically and mentally.<\/p>\n<h2>Switching the Freelance Workload<\/h2>\n<p>Another freelance solution 9-to-5ers can&#8217;t readily implement: changing their workload. Of course, we have clients and contracts but with our assignment comes more flexibility. Freelancers are at the buffet of assignments and we are able to steer ourselves to the carving station or omelet line if we&#8217;d like. When you&#8217;re hired specifically for a job in an office, it&#8217;s much harder to change the objectives placed upon you. Many 9-to-5ers end up doing work they didn&#8217;t sign up for and they are unhappily stuck doing it with no end in sight. Freelancers can shift as the tides roll.<\/p>\n<h2>Taking\u00a0A Minute, An Hour, A Day<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2016\/07\/12\/485606970\/overworked-americans-arent-taking-the-vacation-theyve-earned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Americans are overworked<\/a>. We are busy, busy, busy, never putting down our phones, expecting to be on call all of the time. As a freelancer, the scales may tip back and forth while we financially stabilize ourselves and take advantage of the work-life balance.\u00a0But if we need a mental health day, as many people often do, we can take it. 9-to-5ers are stuck doing most of the things they need to do on weekends or they&#8217;re nervous to make an appointment during the week. Freelancers can solve our problems by making our work work for our lives, not the other way around.<\/p>\n<h2>Conquering The Creative Block<\/h2>\n<p>In my 9-to-5, I had less control over my creative process. Deadlines had to be met and meetings had to be run and I didn&#8217;t have autonomy to figure out what was best to conquer the workload when I was feeling stuck. In an office, the internet can be blocked, you can have cubicle mates, or just a short period of time for lunch. Careers are run based on how the company and the bosses manage their team. While some of that translates to freelance life, freelancers have the ability to handle our careers and our creative process as we see fit. Whether it be taking a long walk, watching some YouTube videos,\u00a0or blasting music, we have\u00a0complete control over how we want to get the creative juices flowing.<\/p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Run It By The Boss<\/h2>\n<p>Like I stated above, we freelancers are our own boss and being your own boss is the top freelance solution that 9-to-5ers wish they could use. The chain of command in an office, if not used correctly, can stifle the worker. Not only that, many are forced to go along with solutions they don&#8217;t agree with. In a 9-to-5 office, the boss rules out. Being unable to solve a problem the way you think is best\u00a0is extremely tough and disheartening, especially if you feel like you&#8217;re not being listened to.\u00a0But freelancers can decide to proceed with their business any way they want and we are lucky to have set ourselves up in that position of power. That ability to employ our skills as we see fit goes a long way.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There are perks to a 9-to-5 life that sometimes a freelancer can miss.
