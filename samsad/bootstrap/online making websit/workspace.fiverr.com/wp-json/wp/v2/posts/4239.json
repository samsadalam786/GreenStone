FIFA states that the hiring party must pay the contractor within 30 days of the project end date.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">If a client fails to pay, FIFA outlines penalties for violating freelancers rights, which include damages, fines to cover legal fees and more.
