Flexible creative thinking and a steady flow of fresh ideas must be counterbalanced with the pragmatism necessary to run one\u2019s own business\u2014especially when it comes to the financials.<br \/>\nFortunately, you don\u2019t need to be a professional accountant (or even a naturally-inclined math-elete) to turn your raw business data into actionable takeaways that can improve your financial stability in the future.<br \/>\nAs you begin to goal-set ahead of 2018, consider these 7 simple calculations that will reveal powerful insights when it comes to the state of your freelance business.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Review seasonality trends<\/h3>\n<p>Map out your income-to-expense ratio by month for the full calendar year. If you\u2019re heavy on retainers, the trends are more likely to be consistent month-over-month, barring any new client wins (or losses) as the year progressed. Freelancers who are more project-based will be more inclined to see spikes and dips in income over time.<br \/>\n<i>Using a freelance accounting software (like AND CO) will make it easy to assess your income and expenses over time.<\/i><br \/>\nSpend some time with your 2017 \u201cins and outs,\u201d noting what changed during the natural ebbs and flows of the year. Did you receive an influx of work in a specific month or quarter? Was there a flurry of new business activity during a particular cultural or industry-related event? From your annual report, jot down 3 assumptions and takeaways that make sense to act on in 2018. Work these into your planning strategy to double-down on the wins (and reduce the impact of missteps) in the year ahead.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Revisit scope accuracy<\/h3>\n<p>Timesheets get a lot of flack in the corporate world, but they\u2019re a necessary evil at large, service-based companies that rely on billable hours to drive revenue. Time-tracking enables an organization to assess the overall profitability of certain clients and teams, ultimately informing important business decisions down the road.<br \/>\nFor a business of one, time-tracking is just as important, and much more manageable. For example, Fiverr Workspace\u2019s intelligent <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">time-tracking tool<\/a> syncs with your invoicing, allowing you to easily bill clients based on actual hours work (versus your best guess). Most time-trackers allow you to track live, a la a stopwatch, or input hours after you\u2019ve completed them.<br \/>\nFor significant recurring clients, do this calculation:<br \/>\n<i>(Hours worked \u2013 hours scoped) \/ hours worked * 100<\/i><br \/>\nThis is the percentage of work you\u2019re giving away for free!<br \/>\n<i>Example: Client A<\/i><br \/>\nScoped at: 10 hours\/week<br \/>\nActual: 14 hours\/week (average)<br \/>\n(14-10) \/ 14 * 100 = <b>29%<\/b> \u2192 Yikes. In this case, nearly a third of the work you\u2019re putting in is unpaid. It\u2019s time to have a chat with your client to calibrate expectations or increase scope.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Compare profitability by client<\/h3>\n<p>As a follow-up to the previous calculation, you\u2019ll also want to make comparisons across your clients to determine which projects are getting you paid most efficiently. Of course, these equations can\u2019t speak to the nuances that might make you value a client for non-financial reasons\u2014but if you\u2019re looking to streamline in 2018, this is the best place to start.<br \/>\nWhen having conversations with regard to scope, data is a powerful asset. If you can prove to your clients that your assessments are based on diligent time-tracking (versus gut feelings, which can make these conversations \u201cup for debate\u201d), then you\u2019ll have a much easier time expanding scope to meet the actual demands of the project, or pushing back on asks to more closely align with the realities of the work.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Resolve incomplete payments<\/h3>\n<p>This one is straightforward but supremely important. If you\u2019ve been juggling multiple clients and projects this year, take stock of your projects and make sure you get paid by EOY. In your outreach, emphasize the mutual benefit of wrapping up loose ends before the year expires, and remind clients of how many days past due they are to underscore the urgency of your ask.<br \/>\n<i>(Psssst: Still having trouble? Try out this <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">demand letter generator<\/a>, which will send a physical letter to late-payers for a cool $3.)<\/i><br \/>\nMoving forward, using an accounting software that reminds you of past due invoices is the best way to avoid late payments. <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a>, for example, will ping you when an invoice is due, let you know how late the payment is, and give you the option to resend the invoice with a single click.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Revisit your expense categories<\/h3>\n<p>The end of the year is also a great time to audit your business spending. Consider all of the categories of expenses and ask yourself if there are any places to cut down or create efficiencies. While some expenses are unavoidable (Internet, domain hosting, etc.), others\u2014such as the coworking option you choose or your business travel habits\u2014might be worth revisiting.<br \/>\nProfitability is a function of money in and money out. While most of your focus next year will be on money in (either maintaining or growing), it\u2019s also beneficial to look at your spending habits and eliminate any unnecessary expenses\u2014especially subscriptions!\u2014as soon as Jan. 1 hits.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Estimate (then reduce) non-billable hours<\/h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a worthwhile exercise to try: For one week, proactively keep track of the time you spend each day doing \u201cnon-billable,\u201d work-related tasks. These can include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any client correspondence that doesn\u2019t involve billable work (e.g. creating contracts, following up on late payment, trying to get a revised SOW signed, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Pitches and proposals<\/li>\n<li>Travel time to and from in-person meetings<\/li>\n<li>Expense reporting and tax preparation<\/li>\n<li>New business activities like pitching, taking meetings, attending events, or scanning job boards<\/li>\n<li>Other administrative tasks (e.g. finding a coworking space, purchasing new supplies, managing your domain\/website, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Here are a few easy ways to shave some time:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a contract template (check out this free wizard courtesy of the Freelancers Union) and stop reinventing the wheel every time you kick off a new project<\/li>\n<li>Use a <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoice-templates\">plug-and-play invoice template<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Create templates for proposals that can be quickly customized based on your prospective client\u2019s objectives and expectations<\/li>\n<li>Face-to-face meetings are important for building relationships, but thanks to the magic of Google Hangouts, you don\u2019t need to schlep to your client\u2019s office every week. When it comes to traveling to meetings, choose your battles wisely. A single hour-long meeting can easily turn into a half-day affair.<\/li>\n<li>Use an\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">accounting software<\/a> that syncs with your bank account so you can easily file away expenses as you make them. Consolidate all of your business expenses on a single card.<\/li>\n<li>Finally, learn to say no. Not every coffee meeting is mission critical, and perhaps it\u2019s time to be more selective when it comes to requests to \u201cpick your brain.\u201d Your time is precious, so treat it as such!<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>7. Estimate self-employment tax ahead of April<\/h3>\n<p>April might feel far away, but the end-of-year tax deadline will come up sooner than you think. As soon as you\u2019re paid out for work in 2017, you should commence the process of end-of-year tax prep. If you\u2019ve been paying estimates on a quarterly basis (if you expect to pay $1,000 or more in taxes, then you should be!), you\u2019ll be ahead of the game.<br \/>\nIf not, take some steps now to avoid hiccups come April. One 5-minute calculation to make is to estimate your self-employment tax obligations for the year. Many freelancers make the mistake of underestimating this figure, forcing them to scramble when it\u2019s time to send a check to the IRS. Use this <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/self-employment-tax-calculator\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">free self-employment calculator<\/a> to get a more accurate estimate. If you under-saved during the year, this gives you three full months to sock away the difference.<br \/>\n<strong>For even more tips for growing your freelance business, download Fiverr
