However, \u201cSearch engine optimization\u201d can seem like an overwhelming monster, that should be reserved for rocket scientists.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, SEO is ANYTHING you do that gets you higher on Google search. A 1% improvement every day can compound to grow your traffic and get you #1 in the long term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you spend any time reading about SEO, you\u2019ll come across things like JSON-LD and Structured data which makes things way too overwhelming and unactionable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll give you 5 highly actionable SEO tips for Freelancers that can be implemented today to improve the rankings of your existing business or to get your freelance career rolling.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Start A Freelance Website<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re serious about your freelance career, you <strong>have<\/strong> to have a website for your business. Having a portfolio on sites like Dribble isn\u2019t adequate.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also it\u2019s really hard to improve your SEO if you\u2019re on someone\u2019s else\u2019s property and don\u2019t have your own website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This includes services like Blogspot and WordPress.com, you should have your own website and domain name.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of SEO friendliness and ease of use, the best ways to <a aria-label=\"build a freelance website (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-build-a-freelance-website-that-gets-you-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\">build a freelance website<\/a> are <a aria-label=\"Webflow (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/webflow.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Webflow<\/a> and a <a aria-label=\"self hosted WordPress site (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">self hosted WordPress site<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Webflow\u2019s performance and speed is better than WordPress. That being said, WordPress is more popular with a ton of tutorials and guides making it easier to use for beginners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To have good performance with WordPress site (website speed affects your rankings on Google) I recommend using a highly rated Managed WordPress Host like <a aria-label=\"Kinsta (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kinsta<\/a>. <a aria-label=\"SiteGround (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.siteground.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SiteGround<\/a> is a good option if you\u2019re on a tight budget.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use a tool like <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Pagespeed insights (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/speed\/pagespeed\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\">Pagespeed insights<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/gtmetrix.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"GTmetrix (opens in a new tab)\">GTmetrix<\/a> to further optimize your site and make it load faster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Pick The Right Keywords<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as you have to <a aria-label=\"pick the right niche (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-build-a-freelance-website-that-gets-you-clients\/#niche\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pick the right niche<\/a> for your services, you also want to target the right keywords. While the search term \u201clogo design\u201d may have a lot of volume on Google, the competition is also really high.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to target longer tail keywords and a wide range of topics. I\u2019d like to illustrate this with an example of \u201cYouTube marketing\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a freelancer offering services for YouTube marketing, instead of targeting the keyword \u201cYouTube marketing\u201d which is super competitive you should target multiple keywords like \u201cYouTube consultant\u201d, \u201cYouTube marketing consultant\u201d and \u201cYouTube Growth Service\u201d.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search volume for these keywords are lower but it&#8217;s easier for you to rank since the <a aria-label=\"keyword difficulty (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.canirank.com\/blog\/best-keyword-difficulty-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keyword difficulty<\/a> is also low. As your site grows you can then target more competitive keywords. Don\u2019t target and try to rank for just 1 keyword. Build a group of multiple related keywords and try to rank for all of them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use keyword research tools like <a aria-label=\"SEMrush (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">SEMrush<\/a> or <a aria-label=\"Mangools (opens in a new tab)\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/jeremynoronha.com\/mangools-review\/\" target=\"_blank\">Mangools<\/a> to get more data. <a aria-label=\"KeywordTool.io (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/keywordtool.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">KeywordTool.io<\/a> is a decent free option for basic keyword and niche research.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. On Page SEO<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Page SEO is basically anything you do on your website to rank higher on Google. 10 years ago, you would have included your keyword 100 times in a single article.&nbsp;<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Google\u2019s much smarter today and that won&#8217;t work anymore. Instead write naturally and keep these few tips in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Write in-depth and clear content. It needs to be to the point and answer questions people have. Link to sources if you\u2019re not answering certain questions.<\/li><li>Ideally include your keywords in the content title (this is what shows up on Google)<\/li><li>Include your keywords in headings in your page if you can.<\/li><li>Have simple urls. Eg. example.com\/freelance-writer&nbsp;<\/li><li>Avoid urls like example.com\/p=32423 or example.com\/services\/worldwide\/writing\/content-freelance-writing-2019<\/li><li>Use high quality images and illustrations. However be sure to compress them.<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Here\u2019s a great article (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/on-page-seo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Here\u2019s a great article<\/a> on On Page SEO if you want to optimize further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Write Problem Solving Content<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Starting a blog (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.adamenfroy.com\/how-to-start-a-blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Starting a blog<\/a> on your freelance website and writing problem solving content is one of the easiest ways to get more leads to your services.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cProblem queries\u201d on Google usually tend to have much lower competition on Google vs the service solutions queries.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going back to my YouTube marketing example, queries like \u201cHow to Add Custom Thumbnails on YouTube\u201d have high volumes but relatively lower competition than \u201cYouTube Marketing\u201d.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a aria-label=\"Writing good content on how to solve a problem (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/bid4papers.com\/blog\/expository-essay\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Writing good content on how to solve a problem<\/a> can easily help you rank higher for problem searches on Google and you can always end the article by pitching your services. Eg. \u201cYouTube just isn\u2019t about flashy thumbnails, here\u2019s how I can help you grow your channel.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer box at the bottom of Google&#8217;s search results is a treasure trove of questions people ask Google. <a href=\"https:\/\/answerthepublic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"AnswerThePublic (opens in a new tab)\">AnswerThePublic<\/a> is a great tool that helps you see what the people are searching for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. BackLinks &amp; Internal Links<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever talk to anyone who works in SEO, you probably have heard them talking about links. Links play a huge part in SEO: backlinks from high authority sites send Google signals that your site can be trusted and hence your rankings improve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Submitting guest posts is one of the easiest ways to grow links to your website. Getting relevant links from your industry should always be a priority.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a software developer, you shouldn\u2019t be building links from sites about puppies. Try and get links from high authority technology sites.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal links are when you link to another post on your own site. If you write a post on YouTube Thumbnails and are currently writing a post on YouTube descriptions, then add a link to the post on YouTube Thumbnails in the new article.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Image Source: <a aria-label=\"Moz (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/internal-link\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moz<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a page on your site that\u2019s not mentioned on another article is like having a room in your house that doesn\u2019t have a door. You want to structure the content on your site and interlink your posts to each other, like a mind map.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally it should take less than 3 clicks to go from the homepage of your website to ANY article on your website.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it! Here are 5 actionable SEO tips that\u2019s worth dedicating a weekend to implement them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me know if you have any questions in the comments
