Flexibility in hours, the ability to be your own boss and the idea of setting your own rates are all appealing prospects when laid out next to the 9 to 5 grind. For women, who already have worse outcomes in the traditional workplace, there\u2019s likely an even greater draw (and that\u2019s backed up by the stats\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2014\/09\/04\/53million\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the majority of freelancers are female<\/a>).<br \/>\nThere\u2019s a belief that women in their 20s and 30s leave jobs because they want to start families, but a study found that actually, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.icedr.org\/research\/documents\/15_millennial_women.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">they leave for the same reasons men do<\/a>\u2014they aren\u2019t getting the opportunity to grow, and they aren\u2019t being paid enough. It makes sense <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aauw.org\/research\/the-simple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">looking at the statistics<\/a>: in the U.S., women are paid 80 percent of what men are paid, and when breaking it down by race, it\u2019s even worse. Asian American women fare better than other ethnicities, making 90 percent of what white men make (and raising the overall average), followed by non-Hispanic white women (76 percent), then African-American women (62 percent), Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders (60 percent), Native Americans (58 percent), and Latina women (54 percent).<br \/>\nThe numbers are pretty dire, so could leaving the traditional workforce altogether be the answer?<br \/>\n\u201cBecause you\u2019re your own boss as a freelancer, you don\u2019t have to worry about being passed up for a promotion because you\u2019re a woman or because you have kids and senior management doesn\u2019t think you are as focused on your career as your male colleague down the hall, for example,\u201d says Jessica Milli, Study Director at the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research.<\/p>\n<h3>The reasons for the gap<\/h3>\n<p>Some of the most commonly discussed factors are education, job title, industry, company and\u2014yep\u2014many women likely leave full-time work and go freelance so they can have more flexibility to care for their families, which costs them when it comes to pay. For most of these factors though, there\u2019s a chicken-or-the-egg question. Are women not getting to the top because they\u2019ve chosen the wrong job title, or are they not getting the job title they want because they\u2019re a woman?<br \/>\n\u201cPart of the reason why freelancing and the gig economy has been so attractive to women is its ability to offer flexible working conditions that allow them to meet their other obligations in their lives,\u201d says Milli. \u201cThe freelance economy doesn\u2019t do anything to alter the gender stereotypes of women being the primary caregivers in their household, it just makes it easier for them to do so.\u201d<br \/>\nAside from these much-discussed factors, it turns out there\u2019s also another reason women are getting paid less. A recent study out of New Zealand\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/women.govt.nz\/sites\/public_files\/Empirical%20evidence%20of%20GPG%20in%20NZ%20-%20Mar2017_0.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ministry for Women<\/a> found that 80 percent of their gap (which is slightly smaller than the U.S. gap) can\u2019t be explained by any of these factors, which they believe boils down to \u201cbehaviors, attitudes and assumptions about women in work.\u201d That includes unconscious bias.<br \/>\nAnd so far, that seems to be what\u2019s happening in the freelance economy, too. A <a href=\"https:\/\/paa2014.princeton.edu\/papers\/141411\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study from Babson College<\/a> found that self-employed women earned very slightly less than salaried women\u2014not too bad, except that freelance men, on average, earned about 50 percent more than their salaried counterparts.<\/p>\n<h3>An even bigger problem for minorities<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s clear from the stats that women who aren\u2019t Asian American or white tend to make a lot less money, but there\u2019s something else important at play. A report from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/2016\/11\/17\/gig-work-online-selling-and-home-sharing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pew Research Center<\/a> explains that gig workers are disproportionately Black and Hispanic, and that gig workers are also disproportionately living in poverty when compared to employed workers. And it\u2019s not just non-white women who deal with this. Transgender women also face discrimination in the workforce. (A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.transequality.org\/sites\/default\/files\/docs\/resources\/NTDS_Exec_Summary.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">study found that nearly 50 percent<\/a> of transgender and gender non-conforming people had some negative experience such as being fired or skipped over for a promotion because of their gender identity.) With all the freedoms of freelance work also come the evaporation of legal workplace protections, meaning it\u2019s easier for clients to take advantage of workers, or to exploit loopholes.<br \/>\nFor Cameron Glover, a black freelance writer, she\u2019s actually found that knowing she doesn\u2019t have the privilege of some others in her field means she\u2019s forced to ignore \u201cimposter\u2019s syndrome\u201d and push her work out to editors.<br \/>\n\u201cI still get it from time to time but I still send out stories and negotiate because as a marginalized person, I don&#8217;t have the same securities of privilege to fall back on,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n<h3>The negotiation game<\/h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for women, generally, is negotiating salaries. For most workers, negotiations and salary reviews aren\u2019t the most fun way to spend an afternoon. But for women, they\u2019re a lot tougher and a lot less successful than they are for men. A study by Glassdoor found that not only do women negotiate less frequently than their male counterparts, they also have <a href=\"https:\/\/www.glassdoor.com\/blog\/3-5-u-s-employees-negotiate-salary\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one third the success rate<\/a> in getting higher pay.<br \/>\nFor freelancers, this is bad news, since work is project- or contract-based, and each one comes with a new round of negotiations.<br \/>\nRebecca Bodenheimer, a freelance writer, editor and academic scholar says negotiation feels uncomfortable to her, and she has regularly realized she was undercharging for her services, which is part of the reason she doesn\u2019t see the freelance economy evening out the gap.<br \/>\n&#8220;We have to negotiate everything, which is proven to backfire for many women, and is just hard for many of us to do because of the way we are socialized not to ask for too much,\u201d she says.<br \/>\nFreelancer Elizabeth Limbach agrees.<br \/>\n\u201cOne of the most important parts of running your freelance business is also the hardest: setting your rates and asking for the pay you really want and deserve,\u201d she says.<br \/>\nWhile the freelance economy might provide a good alternative to a traditional job in a lot of cases, it doesn\u2019t seem to be the panacea we\u2019re looking for when it comes to fixing the pay gap. From the expectation that women will be primary caretakers to the disadvantage they are at in negotiating higher pay, the same issues that tend to affect women in the traditional workforce affect women in freelance.<br \/>\n\u201cEven within the gig economy there are issues that women have to contend with. Implicit bias against women may mean that women get fewer contracts than men, or are offered less money\u2014both of which would contribute to the gender wage gap,\u201d says Milli.<br \/>\n<em><strong>What are your thoughts?
