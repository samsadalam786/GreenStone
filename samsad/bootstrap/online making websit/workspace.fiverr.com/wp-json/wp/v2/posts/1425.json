And according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2016\/10\/06\/freelancing-in-america-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelancer\u2019s Union\u2019s annual <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.freelancersunion.org\/2016\/10\/06\/freelancing-in-america-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Freelancing in America survey<\/a>, there are 55 million of you. That\u2019s a whole lot of independent bosses with their own opinions and agendas. But even though the nature of freelance work varies among individuals, there are commonalities that bind them. Some are awesome and upbeat, like the reasons for freelancing\u2014 which we\u2019ll get into in a minute. But others are less so. Even though public opinions on freelancing are improving, there is still a lot of work to be done. For example, the report identifies health insurance as the primary concern for freelancers. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what does this mean? The American freelancer comprises 35% of the workforce in the United States and last year generated one trillion dollars, a significant chunk of the economy. Freelance work isn\u2019t going anywhere, yet the lingering issues need to be addressed. This new generation is doing just that\u2014by going to the polls. 85% of freelancers are planning to cast a ballot for the next president of the United States, and a majority of those voters are choosing a candidate that they believe have freelancers\u2019 interests at heart. No matter the candidate, the freelance vote in America is a valuable block. We\u2019re only going to see more independent workers as time ticks forwards, and the wise candidate will move to back this increasingly important contributor to the economy.<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in case our presidential candidates aren\u2019t convinced that American freelance, and the world over, work isn\u2019t gaining popularity, here are four reasons why America votes for independent work over the traditional 9-to-5.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Flexibility &#8212; The &#8220;Free&#8221; in Freelance<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For full-time freelancers in America, flexibility was the primary reason for going independent. Just think about how we\u2019re coming up on a major trio of holidays. In a traditional work setting, it\u2019s a nightmare coordinating time away from work with management and the rest of your team. But when you are your own boss, you can communicate directly with clients to set realistic expectations during the most wonderfully hectic time of year. There are major benefits to flexibility outside of vacation time, too. When new software is released, you can grab it whenever you want instead of waiting for a department-wide switch. If you have the urge to move your base of operations, nothing is stopping you from sliding into a cool new co-working space. And when it\u2019s time to campaign to attract new clients, you can sign up for a new class to boost your skills or learn a new one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Extra Income<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Student debt. It\u2019s the recurring joke\/nightmare for millennials of all stripes. On average, a college graduate will be saddled with about <a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/money\/4546940\/colleges-with-most-student-loan-debt\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$30,000 in loans<\/a>. A lot of starting jobs aren\u2019t exactly paying fat salaries, so it should be no surprise that recent grads are looking to scoop up some extra income in order to pay down the barrier to a financially secure future. In fact, a solid 25% of American freelancers are identified as moonlighters\u2014someone with a full-time job that works a freelance gig for some financial breathing room. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Pursue Your Own Interests with Freelance<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you ever told a friend or relative what you majored in, only to have them ask \u201cwhat are you going to do with that?\u201d You stubbornly reassure yourself that it\u2019s all going to be okay, then plunge into an existential crisis, and finally emerge while rationalizing that college was <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all about the experience man<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Maybe your major was the university equivalent of a third party, but it doesn\u2019t mean your degree can\u2019t be put to use. Look, we <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> working with what we\u2019re truly passionate about. Are you a photography geek? Nothing is stopping you from dusting off your camera and selling a few prints or charging for professional head shots. Have a thing for music or history? Food or travel? There\u2019s a good chance that no matter your interest, there exists a blog that will pay you to write about your opinions and insights. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Full Dedication to Work<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Work can be great. But we\u2019re willing to bet that when present with a choice, most of you, America and the rest of the world alike, will vote \u201cliving\u201d over \u201clabor\u201d. In a way, freelancing saves time, which directly translates into more opportunity for personal pleasures. There\u2019s the obvious stuff, like how the choice to work from home (or at least in the neighborhood) eliminates a commute. Boom, you\u2019ve got an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2013\/03\/05\/americans-commutes-not-getting-longer\/1963409\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">extra 50 minutes<\/a> in the time bank. Free of office distractions, you might be able to get into your groove faster. Oh, and you get to cut out those totally unnecessary meetings, too. No surprise that freelancers are finding themselves working less than 40 hours a week and still feeling fulfilled.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Happy almost-election day, you a grand ol\u2019 freelancer.
