We tend to forget that hundreds of types of freelancers exist, ranging from writers to photographers, and even to musicians and cake decorators. Being able to freelance online makes it easy for people to make career choices that deviate from the normal 9-5, and get paid to do something more along the lines of what they love. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, not every online freelancer gets paid the same amount. Some freelance careers are more lucrative than others. And like any other market, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/career-news\/2016\/11\/fastest-growing-freelance-jobs-q3-2016\">demand goes up and down at times<\/a>. Depending on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wisebread.com\/11-freelance-jobs-that-pay-surprisingly-well\">where<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/freelancinghacks.com\/highest-paying-freelance-jobs-earning-steady-income\/\">you<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/karstenstrauss\/2016\/06\/16\/10-great-freelance-and-part-time-jobs-for-2016\/\">search<\/a>, you might see slightly different entries, but the following 10 online jobs are ones proven to pay freelancers more money\u00a0for your skills.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Skills Pay the Freelance Bills?<\/h2>\n<h4>Patent Attorney<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/time.com\/money\/4023097\/freelance-economy-facts-stats\/\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyday Money<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/money.usnews.com\/money\/blogs\/alpha-consumer\/2012\/08\/23\/the-best-paid-moonlighting-jobs-in-america\"><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">US News<\/span><\/i><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a patent attorney is the highest paid career for freelancing online. Freelance attorneys can charge over $100 an hour for work they mostly do on their computer. Patent attorneys are experts in the process one has to go through to obtain a patent. They know how to thoroughly research a client\u2019s invention, the entirety of the patent application process, and, finally, how to write a patent that makes sure an invention is fully protected. While this freelance job is quite specialized, it is a perfect opportunity for patent lawyers to break away from a firm in pursuit of work-life balance. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Voice-Over Work<\/h4>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance voice-over work gives actors an avenue to advance their careers from home. Everyday Money<\/span><\/i> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">also cited voice-over work as <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/contently.net\/2014\/07\/09\/stories\/melodious-world-freelance-voice-acting\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the highest paying jobs in freelance online<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, just below patent law. Technology continues to improve on a daily basis, and it has gotten to a point where voice actors can record pristine tracks from their home for at least $70 an hour. These professionals can utilize their voices for anything from short films to audiobooks in this quickly-growing industry that anyone with acting experience can join, with a small investment in equipment.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Web and Software Development<\/h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a freelancer in the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/blog\/post\/10-top-freelancing-job-categories\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">web and software development<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> field is two-pronged; these professionals build and maintain websites for individuals and business and also do programming work for clients. Web developers tend to help businesses build their brand through updated websites, while software developers program software for specific businesses to help operations run more smoothly. Also existing are flash developers who are in charge of building code for websites and being a company\u2019s go-to IT person. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Digital Marketing<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This position has become more and more relevant as social media platforms grow. Now, businesses are hiring entire teams to focus on their social media presence. However, for small businesses especially, it is much more cost-efficient to hire a freelance digital marketing specialist. This individual is generally given full control over a company\u2019s social media platforms, and acts as said company online. Digital marketing professionals are well versed in how to best use all social media platforms for specific needs, such as building an audience or improving upon a company\u2019s SEO. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Content Writing<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like mentioned at the top, freelance content writing is a very popular career in the online sphere, perhaps due to the fact that it is a versatile position. The same content writer who works on blog content for a small business could also be writing how-to articles for a DIY website or fun couples stories on a bridal website. There are many avenues for freelance writers to take, and most are paid by experience. Freelance writers can be paid anywhere from $10 to $1000 for a specific article, so being a content writer is all about honing your skills and finding the right publications to write for!<\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Certified Financial\u00a0Adviser<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being a financial adviser is becoming a more popular career choice in the freelance sphere. Financial advisers usually begin their careers in an entirely different position\u00a0and switch to advising because <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/2010\/09\/21\/financial-advisor-jobs-employment-leadership-careers-career-change-10-advice.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">it is a job that truly helps people<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Certified financial planners, when freelance, have the opportunity to work on their own terms while, say, helping individuals prepare for retirement, or helping expectant parents budget for the perfect home. The only catch about being a freelance financial adviser is that getting a certification requires at least three years in a finance firm. After that, however, freelancing is fair game. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Public Relations Consultant<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/careerlancer.net\/freelance-pr-consultant\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public relations consultants<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> require a broader range of media knowledge than digital marketing consultants, but work toward essentially the same goal. They are responsible for all of a business\u2019 PR strategies, including but not limited to strategizing, communicating with the media, writing press releases, researching best practices, and updating the website with events and press. A freelance public relations consultant would ideally have media connections and experience as part of a public relations team for a well-known company. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Graphic Design<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/thenuschool.com\/get-started-freelance-graphic-designer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelance graphic designers<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are hired for any sort of visual-based project with which a company needs help. This does not just require art skills, it also necessitates a knowledge of how to best reach specific target audiences. Graphic designers are most popularly known for their work with logos, business card designs, letterheads, and more. Being an independent, artistic contractor requires a lot of networking and research, but graphic designers are always in high demand. <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>IT Consultant<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freelancers with extensive technical support experience can transition from a company day job to being the remote go-to IT help for several companies. Knowing how to troubleshoot is key to being paid the highest rate. Freelance IT consultants should have a vast knowledge of common IT issues and need to be able to research foreign problems quickly. This is a job that can pay well, but only for those who know more than \u2018did you turn it off and back on again?\u2019 <\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Project Management<\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Project management is a very lucrative career choice that comes with money and reputation. A <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/careerlancer.net\/freelance-project-manager\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">successful freelance project manager<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will be able to mediate project objective discussions with an\u00a0agreement between all parties being the end result. Additionally, these professionals more often than not are remotely in charge of teams, meaning that tracking progress and people is a large part of the job. Hiring out work to subcontractors and monitoring their work is also a task project managers undertake. This job has a lot of the qualities of a full-time job, but it can be done on your own time, and from the comfort of home. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These 10 best paying jobs in freelance online span a wide range of fields and professional strengths. If you are considering switching to a freelancing career, check out how to start in one of the above.\u00a0Now, make the transition and have your appropriate rate in place\u00a0so you can get the best paying clients.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whenever people hear about freelancers, they usually think only of freelance writers or one of the more &#8220;obvious&#8221; roles.
