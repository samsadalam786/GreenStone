You maintain your professional development. You network whenever possible. So why aren\u2019t you getting more clients? There are many answers to that question, ranging from psychological to tactical, and likely the reason for your lack of clients is a mix of the two.<br \/>\nStep one is to hone in on the root cause (or causes) of your challenges, so you can address them head on and move forward. Here are three potential reasons with tips for getting past the problem and attracting more clients.<\/p>\n<h3>You don\u2019t put enough stake in your website<\/h3>\n<p>Your commitment to refining and maintaining your online presence\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wearedomino.com\/learn\/freelance-marketing\/40\/How-to-write-an-effective-professional-bio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">including your bio<\/a>\u2014has a direct impact on your business. Your website, social channels, and even email communications are all a reflection of your business and your work. Not only does your website represent your brand, but it makes you accessible to potential clients around the clock, allowing you to attract leads in your sleep.<br \/>\nAt any time of day, potential customers can use your website or online portfolio to learn more about what you do, browse your services, and get in touch. If this destination is poorly designed and\/or hard to navigate, you risk losing points with a potential employer or collaborator.<br \/>\n<strong>How to Get Past It<\/strong><br \/>\nIf your website is a critical piece of your sales process, or if your audience will likely make decisions regarding hiring you based on it, then you might consider paying a web designer to tackle the project.<br \/>\n\u201cAn experienced website developer will know that it\u2019s more than coding your website. They\u2019ll know that design and search engine optimization is important, and that branding is more than a color scheme. It\u2019s how your business makes customers feel, which is conveyed through design, words, and yes, the use of color,\u201d explains marketing consultant <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/allie-gray-freeland\/10-considerations-when-bu_b_7596134.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Allie Gray Freeland<\/a>.<br \/>\nThis has become a cost effective option, even for new freelancers and new business owners because you can often find individuals, rather than an agency, to do the work. In fact, per one study <a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/web-designers\/resources\/small-business-2017-website-survey#PRIORITY\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">40 percent<\/a> of small businesses have used a freelancer or consultant to manage their website needs.<br \/>\nIf you lack the budget, there are myriad of technologies and platforms that have effectively leveled the playing field. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Squarespace<\/a> is an easy-to-use option that offers elegant and sleek templates with drag-and-drop design interfaces. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.b12.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B12<\/a> is another company that uses AI to design gorgeous websites at a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n<h3>You\u2019re afraid<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s normal to be afraid of expanding your business, which means more responsibility and more chances to fail. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.couponbox.com\/us\/press\/fighting-fear-the-7-billion-dollar-price-tag\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fear of failure<\/a> ranks as the No. 1 phobia among Americans. Of those polled, 6 percent cited giving up a promotion and 13 percent cited losing a job as a result of their fear.<br \/>\nAs an entrepreneur trying to build a freelance business or otherwise, this paralyzing fear could be what\u2019s costing you clients. Without more clients, your business is at a standstill, unable to grow or scale.<br \/>\n<strong>How to get past it<\/strong><br \/>\nBeing a solopreneur is about taking calculated risks to grow your business and better yourself, so do your homework, but don\u2019t be afraid to take a leap. The first goal in getting past this fear is to identify its source. Are you afraid of\u2026<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not being good enough for more or bigger clients?<\/li>\n<li>Not measuring up to competitors?<\/li>\n<li>Not being able to run a larger, more successful business?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you know what you\u2019re afraid of, find a mentor or business coach. They\u2019ve likely experienced similar fears and can give you tips and ideas for working through them. When you reach the other side, you\u2019ll be ready to take your business to the next level.<\/p>\n<h3>You need to do less<\/h3>\n<p>You need to have clarity about your ideal client and how your services benefit them specifically. Without this, you deal with sporadic clients, reducing the likelihood of consistent work; not to mention many of these clients may not be ideal, suggests business coach <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/w5-reasons-why-youre-getting-clients-jenn-scalia\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jenn Scalia<\/a>.<br \/>\n\u201cYou must be absolutely clear on who you help and how you help them,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m not talking about being super niched down, although that helps, but you have to be able to express to others what you do in a clear concise manner that is understandable to them.\u201d<br \/>\nThis information informs some of the most important areas of your business, including your marketing materials, sales pitch and outreach process. If someone is unclear about what you provide, they\u2019re more likely to look elsewhere. It\u2019s all about matching up what you have to offer with what a prospective client would value in the context of their business goals. It\u2019s as simple as that!<br \/>\n<strong>How to get past it<\/strong><br \/>\nHere two simple ways to get past this common business roadblock:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look back at previous work. Where have you been the most successful? What work did you enjoy the most? Perhaps this should be your new area of focus.<\/li>\n<li>What is your North Star, or your \u201cWhy?\u201d Why did you start this business? Why are you passionate about it? When leads come in, it\u2019s easy to get distracted by \u201cneeding\u201d the business. Eventually you\u2019re just taking work here and there, and lose track of the reason why you\u2019re doing it in the first place. Return to your North Star to find that clarity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>With this knowledge, you may consider re-branding or modifying your website to represent the new focus. Ask former colleagues or mentors tor react to your positioning and growth strategy. You can even A\/B test two landing pages, one focused and one not, to see which drives the higher quality leads.<br \/>\nThere may be dozens of reasons why you\u2019re not getting new clients, and these three are likely involved in some way. Use them as a jumping off point to determine what\u2019s happening under the surface and how you can remedy it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Searching for freelance work doesn&#8217;t have to be a huge time suck.
