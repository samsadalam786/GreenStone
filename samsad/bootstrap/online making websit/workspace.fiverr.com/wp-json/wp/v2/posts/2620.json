That said, there are plenty of reasons to avoiding the term\u00a0\u201cfreelance\u201d in certain work situations.<br \/>\nThink about it: If you asked someone at a party, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d and they replied, \u201cI preemptively send 35 percent of my salary toward taxes through my employer at a startup, where I\u2019m an engineer,\u201d you would probably look at them funny. But this is what is communicated when you answer that you\u2019re a \u201cfreelance [insert your profession here].\u201d<br \/>\nThere are plenty of blogs admonishing the independent workforce against using the word \u201cfreelance\u201d to describe your work: one <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writeraccess.com\/blog\/stop-calling-yourself-a-freelance-writer\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">warns people<\/a> will assume your work isn\u2019t \u201creal,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fastcompany.com\/3054141\/lessons-learned\/why-i-stopped-calling-myself-a-freelancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another claims<\/a> the term signals to clients \u201clow-cost line items rather than strategic partnerships\u201d, and one that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.writersbone.com\/essays-archive\/2016\/2\/18\/stop-calling-yourself-a-freelancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">insists \u201cbusiness owner\u201d<\/a> is a superior descriptor.<br \/>\n<strong>All of these articles make valid points, but the most critical one is missing: \u201cfreelance\u201d doesn\u2019t actually explain what it is that you do.<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cFreelance\u201d is shorthand for telling them your non-employment tax status\u2014which is not a bad status to have\u2014but even accountants know that someone\u2019s taxes are one of the least compelling things about them.<br \/>\nYou\u2019re a freelance graphic designer, eh? Of what? Websites? Logos? Infographics? For private clients? The government? Any big corporate accounts? If you\u2019re a freelance photographer, you could be shooting anything from weddings to warzones\u2014and it&#8217;s certainly worth declaring which one it is!<br \/>\nIndependent workers are a growing part of the labor force and identifying that way can be an inroad to opportunities and the most appropriate way of describing yourself in certain contexts. Below is a brief overview of when and how to use it.<\/p>\n<h3>When NOT to use &#8220;freelance&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><b>Pitching new business:\u00a0<\/b>If you are approaching a business or individual with a pitch to perform work for them, it is already implied that you are a freelancer. The focus when pitching new work is what precise expertise services you offer. There is little to no risk they\u2019re going to overlook your pitch because they\u2019re unclear about whether or not you want a full-time job with them. Pitch the skills, not the status.<br \/>\n<b>On social media profiles:<\/b>The bio section of your social profiles is precious real estate and the first thing people who look you up will likely find. To make clear that you\u2019re accepting new freelance opportunities, you can add a line after your professional description that says, \u201calways on the lookout for my next great client collaboration\u201d or \u201copen to taking on new, exciting clients. Contact me!\u2019 You get it.<br \/>\n<b>When meeting new people:\u00a0<\/b>People hear \u201cfreelance\u201d and too often assume under-employed, directionless, and unprofessional. It\u2019s not fair, but hey, we\u2019re just the messengers. Describe what you do and throw in a fancy shmancy client or two for good measure to show that you\u2019re legit.<\/p>\n<h3>When to use &#8220;freelance&#8221;<\/h3>\n<p><b>Networking with peers:\u00a0<\/b>Finding yourself among fellow independent workers is often a great opportunity to share news about the industry climate and even connect to possible clients. Your freelance peers know the deal about your work status and you\u2019ll want them to know that you\u2019re one of them in order to make the connection stick.<br \/>\n<b>Talking accounts, payments &amp; taxes:\u00a0<\/b>If you\u2019re looking for an overdue check or introducing yourself to a new accountant, it makes sense to lead with this information.<br \/>\n<b>For specific opportunities geared toward independent workers:\u00a0<\/b>If a conference or panel is seeking independent experts in your field, letting them know that you\u2019re successfully navigating freelance life is key to demonstrating your qualifications. If there is a discount for ongoing education or even coffee for freelancers? Go right ahead! Identifying yourself this way in spaces that are directed to the freelance workforce just makes good sense.<br \/>\n*****<br \/>\nConsidering how much of the independent workforce is made up of creative professionals, it is high time that members of it came up with more compelling ways to classify their work. Your job description should be every bit as robust as the full-time employee. But unlike them, you get to write your own. Choose (and lose) your words wisely.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Considering how much of the independent workforce is made up of creative professionals, it is high time that members of it came up with more imaginative and descriptive ways to classify their work.
