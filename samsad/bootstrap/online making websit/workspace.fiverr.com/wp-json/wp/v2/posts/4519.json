You may think that in today\u2019s world a business page on social media is enough but trending social media platforms will come and go. So although social media should be part of your marketing strategy, your website is a base where you control the content and that you can reference back to clients\u2014without being reliant on the latest Facebook algorithms.<br \/>\nSo how do you go about creating a professional website? The good news is that there are plenty of easy-to-use website builders out there, without the added cost of hiring a website developer. So why not give it a go?<\/p>\n<h3>Make a site plan<\/h3>\n<p>Anyone can make a good website but to make a great website you need a plan. It can be as easy as jotting down an outline of pages you want on there. Then just think about the user journey and where you want to take the visitor.<\/p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated\u2014just start with the basics. A Homepage, About page, and Contact page provide a core structure. Then you will want a page describing and listing your product or services in detail. Simplicity is key when it comes to your website, so try to limit your sublevels. Visitors want to find the most important information as easily as possible and with the least clicks necessary. If you feel like that still sounds like too much, you can always try out a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2016\/03\/21\/how-to-design-the-perfect-one-page-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">one-page website<\/a> to keep it simple.<\/p>\n<h3>Invest in a custom domain<\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019ve never built a website before then it\u2019s easy to experiment with a JimdoFree website (that has a Jimdo subdomain e.g. mywebsite.jimdo.com). You can then try out the different templates and layouts to see what best suits your style of business. However, when you\u2019re ready to take the step towards a professional business then you\u2019ll need a custom domain (website address).<br \/>\nIt\u2019s worth going for a \u201c.com\u201d version of your business name but if it&#8217;s not available there are other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2015\/07\/24\/jimdo-tip-adding-a-new-gtld-domain-to-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">top level domain names<\/a> you can use. Try to come up with a domain name that is simple and easy to spell. It\u2019s worth remembering that the catchier your name is, the more likely people will remember it in the future when they need your service again. Most of the time you\u2019ll be able to purchase your domain name during the signup process for your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Testimonials page<\/h3>\n<p>Some advertising you just can\u2019t buy and that\u2019s feedback from your customers. A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nielsen.com\/eu\/en\/insights\/report\/2015\/global-trust-in-advertising-2015\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report by Nielsen<\/a> started that \u201ctwo-thirds of respondents say they trust consumer opinions posted online.\u201d<br \/>\nSo if customers are giving you great reviews, take a quote and put it on your product or testimonials page. Just be sure to check it\u2019s ok with them first.<br \/>\nRecommendations on your website will make potential clients far more likely to purchase rather than taking a risk on a perceived \u201cunknown\u201d product. If you\u2019ve been mentioned in any press coverage or have an impressive client list then be sure to show that off on your website.<\/p>\n<h3>Choose high-quality images<\/h3>\n<p>Websites are a visual experience\u2014if your visuals or art aren\u2019t up to scratch then it\u2019s unlikely your visitors will go on to read your well-thought out text. Studies show that it takes someone <a href=\"https:\/\/scholarsmine.mst.edu\/cgi\/viewcontent.cgi?article=6127&amp;context=masters_theses\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">under 3 seconds<\/a> to decide whether to stay or leave once they\u2019re on your website. Adding some stunning photos in high-resolution can transform your website into a memorable experience for those potential customers. It worth making sure you have at least one image per page so gather the photos you need and check the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2014\/07\/22\/web-graphics-for-beginners-a-best-practices-handbook\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">size and quality<\/a> you need them in.<br \/>\nYou might want:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An image for your website background or header image<\/li>\n<li>Product photos (If you don\u2019t want to hire a professional photographer here\u2019s an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2014\/12\/02\/improve-your-product-photography-with-a-diy-light-box\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">easy tutorial<\/a> on how to take good ones)<\/li>\n<li>A professional photo of you (no cropped pictures from a night out)<\/li>\n<li>Some behind-the-scenes photos of your office or workspace so that people can get to know you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re not a professional photographer there are <a href=\"https:\/\/support.jimdo.com\/design\/all-about-images\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">plenty of resources<\/a> out there that provide beautiful high-quality stock photography for businesses which is free and looks great on large monitors.<\/p>\n<p>Tip: A good habit to get into is compressing your image file size which you can do easily do with tinypng or tinyjpg depending on the format of the image. Not only will this help your website load faster which in turn may decrease your bounce rate, but getting your image file below 700KB will also <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2015\/06\/12\/how-to-optimize-website-images-for-better-design-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">boost your SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Write great content<\/h3>\n<p>We live in a world where you can get the latest news on your smartphone in real time. People want to find the information they need\u2014and fast. Most viewers will likely skim read your text, so try to stick to short paragraphs and sentences. Scannable text with Headers will help people follow all the information you are presenting. It\u2019s worth asking a friend to check your text is easy to understand and catch any typos that will make your website seem unprofessional.<br \/>\nKeep in mind that humans aren\u2019t the only ones reading your text\u2014<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/blog\/how-to-get-google-to-notice-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google spiders are also crawling your website<\/a>. Many companies have SEO experts to get the maximum reach out of their websites with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2017\/01\/24\/how-to-do-keyword-research-using-keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyword research<\/a>. However, if that\u2019s not an option you can research your own keywords or phrases that people would type into Google to find your website. For example, if your new product is a spiralizer you may want to drop in some associated keywords such as \u201chealthy lunch\u201d, \u201craw food\u201d, \u201cvegan food\u201d in your main body of text or Headers. This type of search engine optimization will help customers find you easier on Google.<\/p>\n<h3>Include calls to action<\/h3>\n<p>Whilst it\u2019s nice that visitors enjoy your website, if you have a business, then your main aim is probably to encourage visitors to buy your product or service. Once you\u2019ve won your visitor over with your engaging text and compelling images about your product then a well-placed call to action will help convert them to a customer.<br \/>\nUse a link or a button with an active voice to convey a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmonitor.com\/blog\/email-marketing\/2016\/03\/75-call-to-actions-to-use-in-email-marketing-campaigns\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">short and immediate action<\/a>. This should give the visitor a clear direction. For example \u201cCurious? Read on\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s go!.\u201d The trick is to create a sense of urgency or anticipation and get people excited about your product in a positive way.<br \/>\nOne call to action <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/2016\/04\/05\/create-better-calls-to-action-on-your-website\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">on each page<\/a> is a good rule of thumb and will avoid your visitor searching around your site to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>Create a logo and brand<\/h3>\n<p>People may not remember a name but you can bet they will remember a great logo. Not only will this make your website more professional but it will help you color coordinate your website and design.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re not a designer yourself, there are plenty of branding packages available that won\u2019t break the bank\u201499designs is a great option. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/en.99designs.de\/contests\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">sponsor a logo competition<\/a> and a variety of great designers will post entries so you can just pick the logo that is right for you.<\/p>\n<p>Remember your website is a space where you can control the content and show off your product or service in the best possible light, so make the most of it. Stick to a simple site plan and get started with the basics then you can add the details later.<br \/>\nThink of your website as a work in progress that you can continuously improve and grow over time. Your website should also be an exciting experience so don\u2019t be afraid to get out of your comfort zone and enjoy the journey.<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Article provided by <\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.jimdo.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Jimdo<\/em><\/a><em>.
