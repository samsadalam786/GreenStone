He wrote to us to ask if he could share a story with our audience. To which we said: hell yeah! This is that story.&nbsp;<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nine-to-five workers, getting paid isn\u2019t an issue. Without even thinking about it, your paycheck just magically shows up in your bank account each month. For freelancers, however, the payment process can be much more complicated.<br>The freelance world is one made up of late payments, currency conversion, and lots \u2014 I mean LOTS \u2014 of invoices.<br>Invoicing software can make this part of your business much easier.\u00a0<br>I use\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/invoicing\/\">Fiverr Workspace invoicing software<\/a> &#8211; and here are a few reasons why.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Keeping track of unpaid invoices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a copywriter, I work with a fast-paced schedule. I wake up, do my morning routine, then write for the next few hours.<br>When you\u2019re busy working on consecutive projects, it\u2019s easy to forget about invoices that have gone unpaid.<br>While I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with clients who settle their dues promptly, the occasional slowpoke is unavoidable in the world of freelancing.<br>If you forget to follow up on an invoice, you may never get the payment; whether the client genuinely forgot or intentionally seized the opportunity to exploit your lapse in memory. Luckily, Fiverr Workspace can ensure that unpaid invoices become a thing of the past.<br>When an unpaid invoice is overdue, Fiverr Workspace will send you a reminder to follow up with your client. The Fiverr Workspace dashboard even shows you how much money you\u2019re owed in outstanding invoices to ensure that you don\u2019t forget to follow up.<br>Unfortunately, sometimes following up isn\u2019t enough \u2014 some clients refuse to pay you for no reason other than greed.<br>When you run into a client like this, it\u2019s time to get physical. No, I\u2019m not suggesting you go to their house and rough them up. Just get physical with a physical demand letter.<br>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/demand-letter\/\">send your client a demand letter<\/a>&nbsp;through AND CO. For just $12,&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/williams-harricks.html\">Williams&amp;Harricks<\/a>&nbsp;will send a physical demand letter to your client to remind them of their overdue balance.<br>You can select the intensity of the letter, with ranges from a polite reminder to&nbsp;<em>The Godfather<\/em>&nbsp;\u201chow are your kids?\u201d threats. (Okay, I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t go that far, but you get the picture.)<br>The letter will be written for you (and sent on your behalf) which saves you the time of writing it and the hassle of going to the post office. In fact, the whole process only takes around five minutes to complete.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>When people get demand letters from lawyers, they suddenly pay up. I used this with a client over the summer and they fedex-ed me a check the same week they got the letter<\/p><p>\u2014 Frank (@StillUpMySleeve)&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/StillUpMySleeve\/status\/1064980073802096640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 20, 2018<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Integrating payment processors<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Given how tough it can be to get clients to pay freelancer\u2019s invoices, making it as easy as possible for clients to pay you can make a huge difference.<br>You\u2019re in luck \u2013 Fiverr Workspace invoices integrate cleanly with numerous payment methods to ensure that the process flows seamlessly on both ends.<br>Once you connect your&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/paypal.com\/\">PayPal<\/a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/stripe.com\/\">Stripe<\/a>&nbsp;account, your clients will be able to pay your invoices with a single click.<br>Many late payments are simply a result of the\u201cI\u2019ll do it later\u201d mentality. One-click payment capabilities can help you get paid a lot faster, and reduce your need to deal with forgotten payments.<br>You\u2019ll also increase customer satisfaction by making it easier to pay. Some of my clients have mentioned the fact that they appreciate the one-click payment system of Fiverr Workspace invoices as it saves time on their end as well.<br>An added bonus of this feature is that if you\u2019re also using&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/expense-tracking\">Fiverr Workspace to track your expenses<\/a>, it\u2019ll automatically add any payment processing fees into your expenses so nothing is missed at tax time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Real-time payment alerts<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve all been there\u2026 following up with a client only to hear the words \u201cI\u2019ve already sent the payment.\u201d<br>When you use Fiverr Workspace for your invoicing, you\u2019ll never need to worry about such shame-filled moments since invoices sent with Fiverr Workspace notify you whenever one of your clients makes a payment, saving you from making unnecessary follow-ups.<br>Another benefit of having payment alerts is the fact that you don\u2019t have to waste time logging into your PayPal account every few minutes to see if your client has paid yet.<br>I myself am guilty of interrupting my work to check if a payment has gone through, and all this checking adds up over time \u2014 drastically reducing your productivity (and increasing your stress levels when you\u2019re constantly reminded of that low balance!).<br>Luckily, when you use AND CO, you\u2019ll be notified as soon as a payment is made so you can focus on your work instead of constantly checking your account.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Looking professional<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending consistent, polished-looking invoices can help you appear more experienced with clients and prospects. \u201cI\u2019ll send you an invoice\u201d sounds infinitely more professional than \u201chere\u2019s my PayPal address.\u201d When clients receive an invoice for your services, they\u2019ll know that you\u2019re the real deal \u2013 a business that has all the necessary processes in place to run efficiently.&nbsp;<br>Invoicing is one of those things that doesn\u2019t seem like an important part of the process at times, but not having a structure in place can certainly come back to bite you when you need it most.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Customization for your invoices<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Representing your brand can be hard when you use third-party software, but Fiverr Workspace is gracious enough to offer extensive customization options. You can change the color scheme of your invoices and even insert your company logo.<br>The ability to stick to a consistent theme while invoicing with Fiverr Workspace is just one of the things that makes this service suite so great.<br>When I first set up the software, I got to customize my invoice preferences, choosing the exact same color that my brand uses, and adding my own logo to all invoices automatically. This level of customization makes Fiverr Workspace feel like an extension of my brand rather than a piece that\u2019s been taped onto it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Automatic invoices with Fiverr Workspace time tracking<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracking time can help you get compensated for every second you spend working, but when you have to spend five minutes tallying your tracked time, calculating the total, and manually adding it to your invoice, the whole endeavor loses its efficiency.<br>Fortunately, Fiverr Workspace ensures that it only takes a few seconds to send out invoices for your tracked time \u2014 so you can track time without wasting it.<br>If you use&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">Fiverr Workspace to track your time<\/a>, you\u2019ll be able to send out automatically-generated invoices that detail the hours you spent on each part of a project with just a few clicks.<br>There\u2019s nothing like a time tracker that helps you save time, and that\u2019s just what Fiverr Workspace does. To learn more about the Fiverr Workspace time tracker, read&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\/\">Martin\u2019s article<\/a>&nbsp;on the topic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Worldwide coverage<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set your invoice preferences to charge in a specific currency or display in your local language, which makes it easy for you to invoice all your clients \u2014 whether they live down the street or on the other side of the world.<br>Clients don\u2019t have time to convert currencies, factor in processing fees, and come up with the total amount they should send. Not to mention the risk of inaccurate calculations by your clients that could lead to you getting less than you billed for.<br>To ensure that you don\u2019t annoy your client by making them do the math whenever you send an invoice and that you\u2019re paid the exact amount you billed for, use Fiverr Workspace to send invoices to your client in their local currency. You can also add local tax rates to the invoice.&nbsp;<br>The fact that my clients don\u2019t have to calculate the conversion rates means I get paid a whole lot faster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Optimize your payment process<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Invoicing can be stressful at times, but when you let Fiverr Workspace handle things, the process will be much easier for both you and your clients.<br>The choice is up to you: optimize the payment process or continue to chase late payments.<br>So what\u2019ll it be, Neo?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Jake\u2019s been a loyal user of Fiverr Workspace for the last five months.
