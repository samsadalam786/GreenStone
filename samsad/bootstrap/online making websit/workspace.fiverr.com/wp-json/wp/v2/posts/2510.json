It can, in some circumstances, involve scrubbing toilets.<br \/>\nThat said, many freelancers have found that working from remote locations has far more benefits than drawbacks. One such talented individual is <a href=\"https:\/\/news.traveldeveloper.com\/travel-developer-working-as-a-digital-nomad-980aff765cc5#.zhk2wgchh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Phil Manning<\/a>, a 28-year-old digital nomad and founder of the Complete Travel Developer Course. Here he drops some knowledge on us about how he\u2019s living out his dreams and making cash-money while doing it.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you working on right now?<\/h3>\n<p>Right now, I\u2019m living in Costa Rica and planning on venturing out to Southeast Asia in the coming months. I currently have a few different clients, one in Costa Rica, one from France and some contract work for Jet.com in the U.S. Additionally, I\u2019m in the process of creating an online course for people looking to become freelancers in design and\/or development. I just finished my <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/sh4kZPFb9E\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kickstarter campaign<\/a> and will be launching the course in late February.<\/p>\n<h3>Sweet. What\u2019s this course all about?<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/traveldeveloper.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Complete Travel Developer Course<\/a>\u00a0covers everything you need to know to become a location-independent web developer. The curriculum includes everything from web development basics, to learning the most popular design tool\u200a (Sketch) and up-selling services with SEO. Students will also learn freelance business skills such as perfecting the cold-email, managing multiple clients, and streamlining their billing and finances. All of these lessons are taught using software and skills that can be used anywhere in the world.<\/p>\n<h3>So, what were you doing before all this?<\/h3>\n<p>I\u2019m a self-taught full-stack developer, designer, and small-business consultant. I went to undergrad at Elon University, where I studied Business Administration with a concentration in Entrepreneurship and minored in Computer Science and Philosophy. After graduating, I went back to my hometown and\u00a0worked various side gigs as I went to General Assembly\u2019s inaugural code immersion course\u200a, called \u201cProgramming Fundamentals with Ruby on Rails.\u201d I then continued my studies online with various courses in a wide range of topics from SEO and mobile design to body language and lie detection.<br \/>\nDuring this time, I started my own freelance business, <a href=\"https:\/\/dooddevelopments.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">doodDevelopments<\/a>, and continued to hustle by bartending and slanging coffees as a barista on the side. After saving up a bit of money\u2014and after Hurricane Sandy decimated the beachside bar I worked at\u2014I decided to take a chance with my freelance skills and travel. It ended up being the <a href=\"https:\/\/news.traveldeveloper.com\/how-i-turned-my-job-eliminating-superstorm-sandy-situation-into-the-greatest-year-of-my-life-c48ab3a0e5ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">best year of my life<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>What\u2019s the biggest challenge of freelancing?<\/h3>\n<p>The most challenge aspect is that the cadence of work can be unpredictable. You constantly deal with either anxiety due to not getting enough work and watching your bank account dwindle, or on the opposite end you get anxious when you have so much work you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll have time to finish everything. Keeping a good structure and work calendar helps with this, but sometimes you have to make some tough decisions on work priorities, not to mention sacrifices in your personal life.<br \/>\nSome of the most fulfilling parts of freelancing come from being able to put your full creative heart into your work. When you have more of a choice over the projects you get to work on and you\u2019re working in an environment that really inspires you, you\u2019ll naturally create your best work. It seems like a simple idea, but even the top companies in the world struggle with trying to create this type of workplace environment for their employees.<\/p>\n<h3>What would you say to people considering the life of a digital nomad?<\/h3>\n<p>Go. Just f\u2014king go! I mean, obviously, have a set of skills first&#8211;bartending, cooking, accounting, graphic design whatever. It\u2019s much easier than it seems once you get mobile. If you grew up like myself being raised to be pumped into a corporate machine you have this massive, unnecessary wall of complexity. It\u2019s not that difficult. And the people doing it are not that special \u2013 they\u2019ve just taken the jump.<br \/>\nThe best advice I ever received was to leverage the power of saying, \u201cNo.\u201d If you have a skill that\u2019s in high demand, you\u2019ll have no problem with getting clients. Don\u2019t ever sell yourself short and always ask for your fair value. And always\u2014always!\u2014write up a scope of work and formal contract. It\u2019s your responsibility to protect yourself from being overworked and underpaid.<\/p>\n<h3>Where do you see yourself in ten years?<\/h3>\n<p>Four years ago I was doing mostly web development projects. Since that time, I\u2019ve migrated to mostly iOS. Ten years from now, I\u2019ll probably be working in whatever comes after machine learning. By that time I\u2019ll probably slow down my nomadic ways and settle down with a family on a farm somewhere in a quiet surf town (location TBD) while working on some of my own personal projects.<br \/>\n<em><strong>Are you a\u00a0digital nomad?
