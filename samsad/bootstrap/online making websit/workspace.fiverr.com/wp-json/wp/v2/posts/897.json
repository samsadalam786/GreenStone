It\u2019s time to trade out your lightweight t-shirts, cold brew, and surfboards for your favorite sweater, lattes, and decorative gourds. But just because the weather is changing doesn\u2019t mean your busy schedule gets put on hold. You\u2019re still going to be grinding it out over the occasional long night. It only makes sense that you have some good music to accompany you on your freelance journey. Swap your BEST OF SUMMER \u201816 WHOOOO!!! playlist for the understated sounds of Autumn. Here are a few tracks to get you started.<\/p>\n<h2>The Freelance Fall Playlist<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<h2>Autumn Leaves (Cannonball Adderley)<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many different recordings of this song, each with their own distinct vibe. After a couple listenings, you\u2019ll more than likely have your own favorite, at which point you should just keep that on repeat. But until that time comes, rock with this one\u2014 a gem from Cannonball Adderley and Miles Davis. It has a leisurely feel that will ease you into whatever projects you have lined up for the day, or keep you solid company on a walk through the park when you need to clear your head. It doesn\u2019t hurt that it can also turn your kitchen into your favorite coffee joint, either.<\/p>\n<h2>So Far to Go &#8211; Instrumental (J Dilla)<\/h2>\n<p>Turn on this instrumental version of this J Dilla classic once you feel yourself back on the up. It\u2019s so uplifting, like a sunny fall morning. The keys that begin to appear around the halfway mark are like rays of sunlight cutting through the shades and spilling onto your living room floor. The beat is exactly what you need when you know there\u2019s a long day ahead of you, but you\u2019re more than ready to take it with the cool confidence that matches the brisk weather outside.<\/p>\n<h2>Heard Them Stirring (Fleet Foxes)<\/h2>\n<p>Do you know why this song is so brilliant? Because it sounds like the Fleet Foxes stepped into the studio to answer one question: How can we capture the sonic essence of flannel, pumpkin spice, crunching leaves, and an assortment of stews bubbling on the stove? And boy did they succeed. With just a chorus of a few \u201coohs\u201d and \u201caahs\u201d, a tambourine, and a steady guitar line, the band proved you don\u2019t need to actually say anything to dedicate a song to the best season of the year. No shade; it just works.<\/p>\n<h2>Idle Moments (Grant Green)<\/h2>\n<p>A freelancer\u2019s lifestyle is an unpredictable one. Clients can be evasive, payments late, or you could just hit a dreaded mental wall. During those times, you probably wish you could stop time. You can\u2019t (yet), but you can do the next best thing with \u201cIdle Moments\u201d. Grant Green\u2019s guitar wraps you up in a blanket of cool sound and slows it all down. Do some stretches or deep breathing exercises and remind yourself that at the end of the day, it\u2019s you who is in control.<\/p>\n<h2>5 bit Blues (DJ Koala)<\/h2>\n<p>The beauty of the blues is its use as musical therapy. If you\u2019ve ever experienced a problem of any stripe\u2014 spurned love, empty pockets, a client from hell\u2014 you can sing a blues tune. It\u2019s probably the most relatable genre of music. So for the times when freelancing just isn&#8217;t going your way and seem a bit out of control, enjoy this blues with a twist. The lo-fi sound and chopped up samples make this fit to blast through your speakers when things ain\u2019t looking all too great.<\/p>\n<h2>Autumn in New York (Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong)<\/h2>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s Autumn in New York, that brings the promise of new love\u2026\u201d It\u2019s officially cuffing season; time to get close with that pile of work staring you down. Just kidding. Like \u201cAutumn Leaves\u201d, \u201cAutumn in New York\u201d is a throwback pop standard, and there are more recordings of that song than there are Kardashian siblings. This particular version is way too cozy to have on in the background while you do work. But if you\u2019ve treated yourself to a generous grocery haul, spent quality time over the stove, and plate your meal like a pro? There is no better song to play when you dine with the lights down low alongside a friend, lover, or your own mind.<\/p>\n<h2>Autumn (Antonio Vivaldi, performed by Midori Seilers)<\/h2>\n<p>Come on, this song is literally called \u201cAutumn\u201d; there\u2019s no way it\u2019s not making it on this list. Baroque music has been shown to boost productivity at work, so why not take full advantage of that with this Vivaldi deep cut? It\u2019s a spritely tune that will keep pace during your most active brainstorming sessions. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve heard this before in a movie or commercial, but this recording is a bit more experimental in approach. Part of what makes it so special and somewhat unfamiliar is the fact that the music is played on period instruments, and Seilers gives the Violin parts a fresh interpretation.<\/p>\n<h2>LFT (Quadron)<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not the best time to go looking for trouble when you\u2019ve got deadlines to meet. Let Quadron to it for you. When you\u2019ve just gotten paid, landed a new contract, or generally just enjoying the feeling of having your act together and priorities straight, toss this song on. It doesn\u2019t sound too wild, but don\u2019t let the vibes mislead you. It\u2019s actually kind of weird to listen to a song about going super hard when it sounds this chill. So turn it up, relax, and reap the benefits of your productivity streak.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Fall is here.
