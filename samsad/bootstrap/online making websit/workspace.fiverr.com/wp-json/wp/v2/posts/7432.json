While they make take a little extra time to document and keep track of, deductions can save you serious money on your tax bill.<br \/>\nHere are a few that freelancers shouldn\u2019t sleep on:<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Self-Employment Tax Deduction<\/h2>\n<p>As a freelancer, you need to pay <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/self-employment-tax-social-security-and-medicare-taxes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">self-employment tax<\/a>, on top of your income tax.<br \/>\nThe self-employment tax covers your share of Social Security and Medicare contributions, which would normally be split with your full-time employer. <span class=\"s1\">The tax rate for self-employment is 15.3% of net earnings which is made of the sum of a 12.4% Social Security tax and a 2.9% Medicare tax on net earnings.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>While the self-employment tax adds to what you might owe, the good news is that you can claim a portion of the tax using the self-employment tax deduction. The deduction is equal to 50 percent of your self-employment tax and is applied towards your adjusted gross income.<br \/>\n<strong>How to Claim:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/self-employment-tax-calculator\/\">Calculate your self-employment tax<\/a> and deduction amount using <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040sse.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schedule SE.<\/a> Copy the deduction amount from Line 6 onto Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) Line 14.<\/p>\n<h2>Office Space<\/h2>\n<p>Do you have a home office? If so, you definitely should take advantage of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/home-office-deduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Office Deduction<\/a>.<br \/>\nYou are likely eligible as long as your home office is where you do most of your work and you use the space regularly and exclusively for freelancing. In other words, if you work at your kitchen table that doesn&#8217;t really count because you also eat there. But if you have a room dedicated to your freelancing job, then you should be covered.<br \/>\nThere are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/businesses\/small-businesses-self-employed\/simplified-option-for-home-office-deduction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">two ways<\/a> to calculate the home office deduction. The regular method uses a complex formula to calculate the actual expenses of your home office space, or you can use the simplified method which gives you a standard deduction of $5 per square foot. The max amount of space you can write off for either deduction is 300 square feet.<br \/>\n<strong>How to claim:<\/strong> If you use the simplified method, enter the amount on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040sa.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schedule A<\/a> (Form 1040 or 1040 SR). If using the regular method, use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f8829.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Form 8829\u00a0<\/a>to calculate the deduction amount and enter it on Line 30 of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/pub\/irs-pdf\/f1040sc.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Schedule C form<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Health Insurance Premiums<\/h2>\n<p>This is a big one.<br \/>\nIf you are paying for your own health insurance premiums, and those of your dependents<span class=\"fr-style\">\u2014<\/span>you can deduct the cost. To qualify you must not have any other health insurance, including being covered by your spouse&#8217;s plan. You also must have some business income, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/publications\/p535\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">amount you deduct cannot exceed that<\/a>. If you had a business loss, you can&#8217;t take the deduction. Also note this is a deduction <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nolo.com\/legal-encyclopedia\/the-self-employed-health-insurance-deduction-a-valuable-personal-deduction.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">towards your personal income tax<\/a>, not your self-employment tax. <span class=\"s1\">The amount for your deduction in 2022 will be limited to expenses that exceed 7.5% of your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income), meaning that the amount of medical expense equal to the first 7.5% of your income isn\u2019t deductible (e.g. if you earn $100,000 the first $7,500 of your health insurance or other medical bills will not be deductible).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to claim: <\/strong>Enter the total amount of eligible health insurance premiums on \u00a0Schedule 1 (Form 1040 or 1040-SR) Line 16.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Advertising<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p class=\"p2\"><span class=\"s1\">When you promote your business you can be entitled to some good tax deductions as a self-employed taxpayer.
