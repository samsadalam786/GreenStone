Using a time-tracker protects you from scope creep<\/h2>\n<p>Time trackers serve as your ultimate truth-teller. You\u2019ll quickly realize that the project you thought was going to take an hour actually took twice as long.<br \/>\nIt&#8217;s even better if you can discover this in the midst of working. If you find yourself allocating more time and resources to a project than what was allowed for in your original <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/the-freelance-contract\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contract,<\/a>\u00a0you can take a step back and\u00a0reprioritize tasks as necessary with your client. Time trackers can help you <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/6-ways-to-avoid-scope-creep-on-freelance-projects\/\">escape scope creep<\/a> by giving you a clear record of your time, so you (and your client) will be able to see where the time went and what needs to be added to get the project completed.<br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fusing-time-tracker-game-changer-freelancers%2F&#038;text=Time%20trackers%20are%20the%20ultimate%20truth-teller%20with%20your%20%23freelance%20work.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Time trackers are the ultimate truth-teller with your #freelance work. <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2Fusing-time-tracker-game-changer-freelancers%2F&#038;text=Time%20trackers%20are%20the%20ultimate%20truth-teller%20with%20your%20%23freelance%20work.&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><br \/>\n<em>Related: <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/introducing-time-tracking-the-benefits-of-managing-your-time-and-productivity\/\">The Benefits of Time Tracking<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h2>2.

Where does the time go? With a time-tracker, you\u2019ll know<\/h2>\n<p>When it\u2019s almost midnight and you\u2019ve been working on a project for the entire day, time trackers can give you a view of what specifically you did throughout that day. If you pay close attention to how much time is spent on non-billable work, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-ways-time-tracking-can-make-you-a-more-productive-freelancer\/\">increase your productivity<\/a> by automating, delegating, or eliminating those tasks. Using <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/time-tracking\">software like Fiverr Workspace<\/a> that saves you time on invoicing, drafting contracts, and following up on late payments can help you automate your tedious, non-billable work.<br \/>\nWith a detailed tracking sheet, it\u2019s easy to set a productivity goal and keep track of where you are. By breaking down how time is actually spent on your billable work, you can figure out what you can do to increase your efficiency.

An extra couple of hours each day might not seem like much, and you may not even notice the effect it&#8217;s having on your health and productivity.<br \/>\nBut seeing the total hours we put in might serve as the wake-up call that we need to dial it back. It can give you a reason for why you&#8217;re feeling so sluggish and rundown.<br \/>\nWhen you review your hours at the end of the week, you can also see how much you actually got done\u2014are you really getting more done by working more hours?
