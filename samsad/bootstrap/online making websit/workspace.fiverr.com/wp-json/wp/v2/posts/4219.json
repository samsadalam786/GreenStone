And if you\u2019re not getting results, it can feel pretty draining. Most of the time, the issue isn\u2019t a question of your qualifications, but a problem with your presentation.<br \/>\nTake the following steps to learn how to write article pitches that actually get the job (or at the very least, a response!).<\/p>\n<h2>Create a Relationship <em>Before<\/em> Pitching<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s hard to ignore the pitch of a writer who is also a loyal reader. So before pitching a publication or brand to write for them, make your presence known to the people involved with content marketing. This means thoughtful comments on blog posts and helping them spread the word on social (aka, the <a href=\"https:\/\/sproutsocial.com\/insights\/social-media-kpis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">most important KPIs<\/a> to these people).<br \/>\nMost freelance writers won&#8217;t take this opportunity to go above and beyond, so this tip for how to write article pitches makes for an easy way to stand out from the crowd. For the best return on your actions, you should start doing this weeks or months before pitching, not the day before.<\/p>\n<h2>Read the Blog<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s one thing to act like you read a company\u2019s blog through some of the above engagement tactics, and it\u2019s a completely different thing to <em>actually <\/em>read it. The best preparation for writing a pitch is to understand what a successfully accepted pitch actually looks like (aka, the final published blog posts).<br \/>\nBy creating a familiarity with the blog content itself, you\u2019ll also gain an understanding of what topics have already been done to death. If there\u2019s something similar you\u2019d like to pitch, you\u2019ll have to be prepared to make a case for how your piece can add value (like an easy opportunity for internal linking!). To make sure your topic hasn\u2019t been covered, do an in-site search as such:<br \/>\n<em>\u201cTopic\u201d site:theblogyouwanttopitch.com<\/em><br \/>\nWhether the blog has explicit writer\u2019s guidelines or not, reading a company\u2019s blog will also give you an idea of overarching topics they want to be covered. Which brings us to the next important tip for how to write article pitches:<\/p>\n<h2>Read their Writer\u2019s Guidelines<\/h2>\n<p>Not every blog has writer\u2019s guidelines, but more and more are starting to realize that having this document ensures a high level of quality and consistency with submissions. So if this document exists, it\u2019s in your best interest to consult it for clues to help you understand the editor who created them.<br \/>\nAnd even if they <em>don\u2019t<\/em> have writer\u2019s guidelines (or don\u2019t share them with first-time pitchers), do some sleuthing to determine:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Overarching subjects.<\/strong> Look at the blog\u2019s categories and tags to get this information.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Their audience.<\/strong> Both their blog and website\u2019s about page will shed some light on the marketing personas each topic should appeal to.<\/li>\n<li><strong>What topics get the most engagement.<\/strong> Find which posts get the most comments and shares. When pitching topics, you can reference these posts relative to your idea to show that you did your research.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Find the Editor\u2019s Name<\/h2>\n<p>If your introduction contains the words, \u201cTo Whom it May Concern,\u201d you\u2019ve already been counted out. It\u2019s probably better to go with \u201cHey\u201d or \u201cHello\u201d if you don\u2019t know the editor\u2019s name, but that\u2019s <em>not<\/em> a part of the ideal process for how to write article pitches that get the job.<br \/>\nInstead, use your powers of deduction to suss out the editor\u2019s name (and ideally, their direct email address). A few easy ways to do this:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look for staff bios on the company\/publication website.<\/li>\n<li>Subscribe to email updates. Oftentimes, the editor is the \u201cname\u201d behind any blog-related email sends. If you\u2019re lucky, the email they\u2019re sending from is one they respond to!<\/li>\n<li>Look up the company on LinkedIn. Click through to see a list of employees who work there. From this list, search \u201ccontent\u201d or \u201cmarketing\u201d (or even \u201ceditor\u201d if it\u2019s a bonafide publication) to find the most relevant person to contact.<\/li>\n<li>Do a Google search for \u201ceditor\u201d + the company\u2019s name. Sometimes the most obvious option is the one with the best results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Create a Pitch Template<\/h2>\n<p>Up until now, much of the process for how to write article pitches has been primarily based on doing your research and being proactive about creating a relationship with the company you\u2019d like to write for. At this point, you\u2019re <em>finally<\/em> ready to actually write the pitch\u2014about time, right?!<br \/>\nA successful freelance writer will write so many pitches that it will feel like a job in and of itself. To make the process easier, it can be useful to create a pitch template. If you write for a couple of different niches, create a pitch for each one.<br \/>\nBut\u00a0<em>never<\/em> send a pitch without customizing it for the intended company. A form letter is easy to sniff out, but a <em>clearly<\/em> custom pitch can make the difference in standing out from other applicants.<\/p>\n<h2>Pitch a Potential Article Title<\/h2>\n<p>Many writers pitch the basic topic with a final title \u201cto be determined.\u201d Another secret for how to write article pitches that get the job? Pitch a final title option with confidence. Besides taking the time to create a headline that\u2019s bound to get attention, show that you\u2019ve done some keyword research to demonstrate that it\u2019ll pull in traffic on multiple marketing mediums.<\/p>\n<h2>Demonstrate Your Knowledge<\/h2>\n<p>If you know the topic inside and out, don\u2019t be afraid to show it. Be confident in your abilities, and the editor can\u2019t help but be influenced to give you serious consideration.<br \/>\nDemonstrating your knowledge is best accomplished through published samples. Published samples show that they won\u2019t be the first person to take a chance on you, and can also provide additional insight as to the power of your written word (through comments, shares, formatting, etc). If you frequently share relevant content on your social channels, it couldn\u2019t hurt to direct editors to those profiles to demonstrate an additional level of expertise.<br \/>\nBut if you<em> don\u2019t<\/em> have any written samples for the niche that you\u2019re pitching, all is not lost. It\u2019s ok to be upfront that you haven\u2019t written on the topic before. But again, exude confidence in your ability to execute your idea. Cite past jobs, projects, etc. that make you the perfect fit for the article you\u2019re pitching. Don\u2019t forget to include a link to your portfolio so that they can get a taste for your writing ability as it relates to the topics you <em>have<\/em> covered.<\/p>\n<h2>Provide a Brief Outline<\/h2>\n<p>Another easy way to stand out from the typical pitches an editor receives? Write a couple sentences or subheadings to help your pitch come to life, and demonstrate that you\u2019ve thought about your pitch far past the title.<\/p>\n<h2>Keep Your Pitch Short and Sweet<\/h2>\n<p>Length is not indicative of quality. Knowing how busy an editor can be, they\u2019ll appreciate a pitch that gets straight to the point in as little text as possible. So lead in with your topic as the most important piece in your pitch email, then share additional information about you and your experience in the proceeding sentences\/paragraphs.<br \/>\nAlso, remember the pitch is not about <em>you<\/em>. It\u2019s about what you can do to help make the editor shine in her job. Make sure your pitch answers the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d from the perspective of the editor.<\/p>\n<h2>Identify Potential Sources<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on the nature of your topic, it may be necessary to coordinate interviews with experts or identify sources for quoting statistics. Address these things upfront with an editor, so that you can close the loop on any doubt they might have about your ability to complete your proposed topic.<br \/>\nIf you know of any relevant articles right off the bat, link to them. If there are some experts within your network that you\u2019re positive you can get an interview with, mention them. If you plan to use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.helpareporter.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HARO<\/a> to find additional experts, say that too. The more you can do to improve their perception of your ability to rock your topic, the better chance you\u2019ll have to do it.<\/p>\n<h2>Do Some of Your Own Editing<\/h2>\n<p>Your pitch is essentially your resume and cover letter for getting a job. Don\u2019t mess it up by sending an email that has even <em>one<\/em> spelling or grammar error. It will reflect badly on your ability to write, and may be the one thing that stands in between you and your pitch coming to fruition.<\/p>\n<h2>Ask for a Response<\/h2>\n<p>Marketing 101 dictates a clear call to action with each campaign and effort. Even if your pitch is not accepted, it would still be nice to get some feedback &#8211; or at least some closure!<br \/>\nTry adding one of the following to the end of your pitch:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cEven if i\u2019m not the perfect fit, I\u2019d appreciate your feedback!\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cIs there a fit here?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>\u201cDoes this seem like something that [publication] would be interested in?\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Be Afraid to Follow Up<\/h2>\n<p>Editors are busy and it\u2019s understandable that a pitch might get lost in their inbox. It\u2019s definitely OK to follow up (ideally on the original email thread) once or twice. If you still don\u2019t hear back, it\u2019s time to move on.<br \/>\nPitching is as much art and science. Even if you get it right with one editor\/publication, the same strategy might fall flat with another. But by implementing these critical pieces, your chances of success will increase with each new pitch.<br \/>\nFor practice pitching, <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSd-nWRjweZNunMvufUQBoEfarHJOPfXIaYzGLNvj55q5TK0RA\/viewform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">99Designs\u2019<\/a> pitch form offers a lot of awesome prompts to help flesh out a topic.
