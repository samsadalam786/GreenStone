Some of that is because you don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. And a lot of freelancers don\u2019t know that hiring an extra set of hands is even an option.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>I mean, you may know it\u2019s an option but do you know it\u2019s an option for <em>you<\/em>?<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Freelancing is a gamble in a lot of ways and when you set out at the start, there aren\u2019t necessarily grand plans in the works for what you expect your business to become. For many, the motivators start out small.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>You want flexibility. You want to be your own boss. You want to do work you\u2019re really passionate about. Perhaps you also want to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/make-transition-nomadic-lifestyle\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"transition into a nomadic lifestyle (opens in a new tab)\">transition into a nomadic lifestyle<\/a>.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It isn\u2019t until you\u2019re in the grind and finding success in your efforts that you see those original motivators evolve and expand. This is business in a nutshell \u2014 regardless of how it\u2019s registered on paper \u2014 a vision that grows and scales over time.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, you don\u2019t <em>have<\/em> to work long hours and operate off zero work-life balance to be successful. You can have it all and then some when you make the decision to hire help.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Consider Hiring to Grow Your Freelance Business<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>If you haven\u2019t read <em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B002WE46UW\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"The 4-Hour Workweek (opens in a new tab)\">The 4-Hour Workweek<\/a><\/em> by Tim Ferriss just yet, put it on your list of to dos.\u00a0<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>He\u2019s got this great quote that I try to live by in my own business: \u201cFocus on being productive instead of busy\u201d.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s certainly easy to stay busy \u2014 but it takes effort to actually get things <em>done<\/em>. And it\u2019s not reliant on the amount of time you\u2019re putting in. Just take Microsoft\u2019s results from an experiment with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.huffpost.com\/entry\/four-day-working-week-microsoft-japan_n_5d77c236e4b0fde50c2dec9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"4-day workweek in Japan (opens in a new tab)\">4-day workweek in Japan<\/a> as an example.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is that you need to be using your time wisely as a freelancer if you want to boost your outputs.&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why you should consider learning how to subcontract work:<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Increase Your Capacity<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Peel the layers back from the service provided to clients and what you\u2019re really selling as a freelancer is <em>time<\/em>.&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>It takes a certain number of hours to achieve the promised results \u2014 hours that you can\u2019t multiply or sustainably take away from other areas of your life (e.g. sleep) in order to accommodate the workload.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Hiring gives you more hours to work with. It increases your capacity to take on more work and focus on the otherwise neglected areas of your freelance business in need of attention.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Keep Your Freelance Business Running (Even When You\u2019re Not)<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many freelancers are at the mercy of their billable hours. Meaning that if they want to take a vacation or even a sick day, they must do so without pay. Not exactly ideal!<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>When you hire help, you make it possible to run a business without having to be <em>on<\/em> all the time. This capability naturally increases with the more employees you take on but even one set of extra hands can do a lot for your peace of mind.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Better Balance Rush Orders and Client Emergencies<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re an operation of one, everything falls on you. Your clients aren\u2019t coordinating their needs conveniently around each other. They\u2019re making requests based on their own timing and priorities alone.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Having employees to help you pick up the slack when emergencies and last-minute requests arise benefits both your revenue and relationships. It speaks to your professionalism and accountability, which in turn snowballs into more trust, referrals, and business over time.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Different Types of Help to Hire<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>You can take a few different routes with the help you choose to hire. It\u2019s all dependent on where your business is at financially and what you have time to manage in the present.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Different types of help to consider hiring as a freelancer most commonly include:<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Virtual assistants<\/strong>: these are people typically hired to help with research, administration, and other operational tasks as they arise in your business.<\/li><li><strong>Subcontractor<\/strong>: these tend to be more specialized workers (i.e. freelancers who serve a specific industry), who might help you consistently or on a project-by-project basis.<\/li><li><strong>A full-time or part-time employee<\/strong>: these workers often fall into more dedicated departments of your business, putting in a set amount of hours weekly.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Naturally, there\u2019s a variety of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zenefits.com\/workest\/the-types-of-employment-a-quick-reference-guide\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"other worker types (opens in a new tab)\">other worker types<\/a> out there. What you choose to go with will be important in terms of payroll taxes and benefits.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Where to Look for a Virtual Assistant<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As someone with ample experience finding, hiring and <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"growing a business with virtual assistants (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.the-blogsmith.com\/virtual-assistants\/\" target=\"_blank\">growing a business with virtual assistants<\/a>, I\u2019ll say that some are definitely better than others. I even teach an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.skillshare.com\/classes\/How-to-Grow-Your-Business-with-Virtual-Assistants\/114207129\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"entire class (opens in a new tab)\">entire class<\/a> on the subject for all my structured, more visual learners out there.\u00a0<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>In general, the trick is to find someone that allows you to make a profit, accounting for the time it\u2019ll take to manage and review their work. But how do you find this person?<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Do your research and hit up popular marketplaces for virtual assistants like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/categories\/business\/virtual-assistant-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Fiverr (opens in a new tab)\">Fiverr<\/a> and Craigslist. Since referrals are always preferable in the hiring world, you can also take it to social networks like LinkedIn for recommendations on talent that best aligns with the level of experience you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Tasks You Should Consider Delegating<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve recruited, interviewed, and hired on your first employee, the work really begins. There will be some growing pains to get used to, especially if this is your first time managing people. The key: be purposeful and organized in the <a href=\"https:\/\/plan.io\/blog\/how-to-delegate-like-a-pro\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"delegation of tasks (opens in a new tab)\">delegation of tasks<\/a>.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Remember, having more hours to work with won\u2019t automatically increase what you\u2019re capable of getting done. You need to make sure both your own hours and those of your hires are productive.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Here are a handful of tasks to consider delegating for the sake of growing your freelance business\u2019 potential.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Stuff You Hate Doing<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>There are bound to be things that you hate doing as a business owner, either because you\u2019re not good at them, have other more important things to do, or some combination of the two.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>The rub here is that the stuff you hate is usually still important. For me, this was bookkeeping. I hired someone to handle that for me \u2014 giving me more time to focus on the areas of my business that I\u2019m most passionate about.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Subsections of a Project and Specialized Work<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>A project\u2019s size and complexity may require some assistance \u2014 especially if it involves an area of expertise you\u2019re not exactly a master at. For example, maybe you\u2019ve been contracted to create a 60-page whitepaper.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re a writer by trade, having a subcontracted graphic designer at your disposal puts you in a better position to deliver on an end-product you can feel truly proud of. So put the strengths of your team to the best possible use.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Administrative and Client-Facing Tasks<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Despite the many online resources and tools out there for running a business, managing them still takes time. As does managing your client workload.&nbsp;<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>We often underestimate just how time-consuming administrative tasks can be in the day-to-day.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>This is where having help from a virtual assistant can come in clutch. Start with the small stuff when delegating tasks to new hires and you\u2019re still likely to see a big difference in how much more time you can focus your own efforts elsewhere.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Depending on the number of clients currently in your repertoire, it might be worth putting together an intranet using Google Sites. Your intranet can serve as a centralized location for detailing nuances across clients, as well as documenting processes and minimizing errors. Breaking down every client task into a checklist is great for this \u2014&nbsp;as long as you make sure to actually follow your checklist.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>Business Development<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Many freelancers aren\u2019t salespeople by trade. They have to <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-write-article-pitches\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"learn the art of pitching (opens in a new tab)\">learn the art of pitching<\/a> in real-time, while also delivering on what\u2019s already been sold.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Offload some of this burden by delegating sales-related tasks to your hires. Relevant tasks could involve updating or building out lead-generation campaigns on your website, sending out <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/5-steps-to-write-cold-emails-that-convert-freelance-clients\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"cold emails (opens in a new tab)\">cold emails<\/a>, creating an email marketing flow, or researching potential blogs to create guest posts for.\u00a0<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>All of these tie back to driving more sales and nurturing relationships at varying stages of interest.<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts: How to Subcontract Work to Grow Your Freelance Business<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, it\u2019s important to realize just how resilient and bold you are in choosing to pursue this career path. It doesn\u2019t come easy and the fear involved in running your own show is enough to keep many from ever taking those first steps.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Your business is capable of returning on so much more than working from home in your pajamas. Take the leap into hiring, make mistakes, and learn as you go. As long as you\u2019re trying, you\u2019re growing.<br \/><\/p>\n\n\n<p>And even if you\u2019re not ready to hire help just yet, there\u2019s a good chance that you can still create efficiencies by <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-automate-every-part-of-your-freelance-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"adding automation to your workflow (opens in a new tab)\">adding automation to your workflow<\/a>.
