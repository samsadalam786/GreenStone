It was everything, the only thing that kept me sane some days.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, some 15 years later, my to-do list continues to grow as I build a family and a business.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m sure you experience the same love-hate relationship with a full task list. Juggling many balls at once is a signature mark of a talented freelancer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the one hand, you\u2019re happy to have lots of work and a thriving business.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, you have to remind yourself: \u201cIf I don\u2019t get this task done, no one will.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you frequently add tasks to your to-do list, hoping you can stay organized enough to get everything done on time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in today\u2019s&nbsp;<em>Pro Freelancer Fundamentals<\/em>&nbsp;article, we\u2019re going to share a few critical task management strategies to help you get more done, on time, and in less time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Getting More Done<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the first thing that comes to mind when we think of freelance task management is getting more things done.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often think to ourselves, if I can just get MORE done in my freelance business, I\u2019ll&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/why-some-freelancers-bring-in-big-money-while-others-struggle-to-find-work\/\">start making more money<\/a>,&nbsp;and life will be easier.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while that\u2019s partly true (particularly if you bill hourly), getting things done just for the sake of checking them off your to-do list isn\u2019t always a \u201cwin.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key to getting more things done is to better prioritize your daily tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Prioritizing your most important tasks<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As David Allen puts it in his signature book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity\/dp\/0142000280\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Getting Things Done<\/a><\/em>, \u201cYou can do anything. But not everything.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not every task is created equal. And yet, if we use a rudimentary task management tool (like the notebook in my pocket I told you about earlier), then all tasks just get added to the same list with the same importance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can quickly overwhelm you and cause you to fall behind instead of making meaningful progress.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, try using&nbsp;task management software&nbsp;to help you prioritize. Using a sophisticated solution will allow you to mark some tasks as \u201curgent\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d while others can be deferred to a later date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/task-manager\">the AND.CO Task Manager<\/a>&nbsp;to automatically prioritize your most critical tasks. Things that require urgent attention, like an unpaid invoice, get bumped to the top and not buried somewhere in a static to-do list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Hitting Deadlines<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, getting more done only matters if you\u2019re also getting things done on time and hitting important deadlines.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why you should do one of the following with every single task that comes into your ecosystem:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Just do it now (less than five mins)<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the task takes less than 5 minutes, just do it now. This will keep your task list lean and efficient.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you find yourself frequently adding five-minute tasks to your \u201cdo now\u201d list, you may need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/how-to-use-time-blocking-to-be-more-productive-a-guide-for-freelancers\/\">group them into larger time blocks<\/a>&nbsp;and add them to another option below. After all, 12 five-minute tasks are equal to a one-hour task.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Finish it today<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the task is urgent but takes more than five minutes to accomplish, add it to your list of must-dos for today.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep this list shorter than you think you need to at first since we tend to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Planning_fallacy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">overestimate how much we can actually accomplish<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should aim to have three to five items on your \u201cdo it today\u201d list at any given time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find you weren\u2019t able to accomplish it today, after all, use a \u201csnooze\u201d feature or a \u201creschedule\u201d feature to reassign a new completion date.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Add it to your calendar<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything else that is less urgent (doesn\u2019t have to happen today) and can\u2019t be accomplished in less than five minutes should get added to your calendar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some task management apps have a calendar built-in. At a minimum, you should be able to add a date to every single task you take on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/task-manager\">AND.CO Task Manager<\/a>, you can then sort your tasks by date to hit all your deadlines (and even get ahead of them).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also want to add your tasks to your actual calendar to physically set aside the time you\u2019ll spend to accomplish the task.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Saving Time<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, developing the world\u2019s best task management system for your business won\u2019t do you any good if you spend double the time just managing the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make your task management process work for you (instead of becoming a slave to it yourself), here are some critical things to keep in mind:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Start as simply as possible<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you\u2019re revamping your task management process, start simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be tempting to fall prey to \u201cshiny object syndrome\u201d as you explore the many different&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/millo.co\/7-best-project-management-tools-freelancers-solopreneurs\">productivity tools<\/a>&nbsp;out there.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, start with something that fulfills your most important and basic requirements. We\u2019ve intentionally kept&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/task-manager\">the AND.CO Task Manager<\/a>&nbsp;simple yet powerful so you can get back to your most important work: actually growing your business\u2014not managing your tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Have one entry point<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to fall behind on your important tasks is to get overwhelmed and overloaded through dozens of different sources.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your clients send you to-dos via email, text message, messenger, or your Fiverr profile, consider finding a way to consolidate. For example, encourage clients to only communicate via one singular channel.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, develop quick and repeatable ways to get tasks from your communication point to your task manager.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Automate task creation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing you want to do is spend hours each week just creating tasks in your Task Management software.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while you often need to manually create a task, some project management software can help with this.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/task-manager\">AND.CO Task Manager<\/a>&nbsp;automatically creates tasks based on your deadlines, projects, and contract terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve got new invoices to send, contracts to sign, or expenses to file, we\u2019ll put them directly on your task list, where you can organize and prioritize for later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Don\u2019t lose sight of \u201cwhy\u201d<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Above all, as you\u2019re working on developing a powerful to-do list system for your business, don\u2019t lose sight of why you\u2019re doing it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get more done in less time and enjoy more freedom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/getflywheel.com\/layout\/6-must-have-processes-to-scale-your-web-design-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">develop a process<\/a>&nbsp;that ultimately requires an extra hour every day just to manage your tasks, it may not be worth it. Keep working on finding a good solution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you feel your task management tool getting OUT of your way more than it slows you down, you know you\u2019re in a good place.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Years before I started working for myself, I spent some time volunteering in South America, and&nbsp;I quickly found myself overwhelmed with everything that needed to get<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":110,"featured_media":10256,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[2,19],"tags":[109],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.6 -
