There are different rules for military members, though, and there are other qualifying reasons why you can qualify for \u201cspecial tax treatment,\u201d so be sure to read the fine print.<\/li>\n<li>The total time allowed for an extension does not usually exceed six months.<\/li>\n<li>Form 4868 also explains that, the late payment penalty won\u2019t be charged &#8220;if you can show reasonable cause for not paying on time.\u201d You have to attach a statement to your return fully explaining the reason.<\/li>\n<li>If you pay at least 90 percent \u201con or before the regular due date of your return through withholding, estimated tax payments, or payments made with Form 4868,\u201d and \u201cthe remaining balance is paid with your return,\u201d then that is considered \u201creasonable cause\u201d for you to not incur any penalties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Potential penalties for&nbsp;late-filing<\/h3>\n<p>Besides a late payment penalty, there is also a penalty for filing late\u2014so even if you\u2019re going for an extension, be sure to do so before the due date. If you file late, you may be charged both the late filing penalty and the late payment penalties, incurring feeds that can add up quickly.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The penalty for late payment is \u201cgenerally 0.5&nbsp;percent of your unpaid taxes per month,&#8221; but it can increase&nbsp;25 percent of your unpaid taxes in some cases, according to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/things-you-should-know-about-filing-late-and-paying-penalties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IRS.<\/a><\/li>\n<li>When both the late filing and late payment penalties apply, \u201cthe maximum amount charged for the two penalties is 5 percent per month.&#8221;<\/li>\n<li>There\u2019s a minimum penalty if you\u2019re more than 60 days late when filing: $205, \u201cor, if you owe less than $205, 100 percent of the unpaid tax.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Anyone who is considering filing a tax extension should heed the IRS warnings, keep themselves organized, and, even when filing an extension, be careful not to lose hard-earned income on penalties, interest fees, and the hassle of having to deal with the IRS for months after everything was due.<br \/>\n<em>Note: The author of this article is not an accountant.
