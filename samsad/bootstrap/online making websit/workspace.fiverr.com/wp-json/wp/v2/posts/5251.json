In fact, despite spending 18 months preparing for GDPR, Facebook was pummelled with a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-44252327\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">$4.5B lawsuit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on day 1, and complaints have been filed against Google, Instagram and WhatsApp too. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time to make sure you\u2019re safe!<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>The steps you should take to ensure you\u2019re compliant<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let me start by saying I am definitely not a lawyer, so please don\u2019t take this as legal advice and talk to your lawyer to discuss how the new laws will apply to you specifically.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><i> <\/i><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep in mind that you only need to comply with these laws for users from the European Union, so you could separate out users from within the EU and deliver a GDPR-compliant experience for them if you think these actions would limit your marketing to people from other countries.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Review your email marketing practices<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do any kind of email marketing or collect email addresses for a newsletter, you\u2019ll need to review how you\u2019re gathering, using and storing that data.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Review your methods of consent<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under GDPR, you must use a tick box for people to give their consent for you to keep their data, and it can\u2019t be pre-ticked. It must be a positive opt-in too &#8211; so you can\u2019t ask people to \u2018tick here if you <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">don\u2019t<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> want to be on the email list\u2019.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Setup double opt-in for your newsletter<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Especially if you might not have a checkbox somewhere, make sure to have double-opt in active for your newsletter. This means people who subscribe to your list receive a confirmation email, where they\u2019ll need to click a link to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.voilanorbert.com\/verify\/\">verify their email address<\/a>. Consent is a big part of the regulation, and this is the best way to prove that people on your mailing list gave their permission to be on it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use Mailchimp, this is likely already setup, as they make double-opt in standard now. They also offer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.mailchimp.com\/gdpr-tools-from-mailchimp\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GDPR-friendly forms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you use a different mailing software, it\u2019s worth checking their specific advice too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Communicate to your subscribers how their information is used<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new regulations, you need to make sure it\u2019s clear to users what they are signing up for. Be specific about what communication they\u2019ll receive from you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Give people a way to delete themselves from your email list<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of your emails should have a clear unsubscribe button, and you must be able to delete all of a user\u2019s personal information on request.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Make sure your data is secure<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you\u2019ve collected people\u2019s emails or other data, it\u2019s then essential that you store it in a secure way. There are some general precautions you should take to keep your data secure (like protecting against viruses), as well as some more extreme steps you can take if you want to be doubly sure. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Protect against viruses and malware<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Security of data needs to be a top priority; this means ensuring you have adequate protection from malware and viruses.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Use a private VPN when working in public<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beauty of being a freelancer is that often, you can work from anywhere. But if you\u2019re working from public WiFi in your local Starbucks, you\u2019re much more susceptible to data being intercepted. Make sure you use a private, encrypted network.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Backup data securely<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There\u2019s nothing worse than losing your laptop or memory stick &#8211; especially when it\u2019s full of your life\u2019s work. Secure backups are just good practice for a freelancer, but they\u2019re also crucial if you hope to comply with data breach reporting and notification requirements of the GDPR. You are required to notify anyone whose data may have been compromised as part of a breach &#8211; something which would be pretty difficult without a backup.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Encrypt your devices<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we\u2019re on the subject, if your device is lost or stolen, you need to make sure any data on there is secure. Password protecting your devices is not enough &#8211; the data could easily be transferred to another machine and read. Conduct a complete audit of all devices used to store client information and ensure they\u2019re secure and encrypted &#8211; typically your computer, phone, or hard drive. It\u2019s also a good time to securely delete any documents you no longer need to keep.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Review and accept the new Google Analytics Data Retention terms of service<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use Google Analytics to track traffic to your site, you may have already seen a notice pop up in the header bar at the top of your analytics account. Make sure you check your settings and accept the terms of service.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Keep data that&#8217;s essential for your business<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s also good to know that under GDPR you\u2019re allowed to keep data if you need it for legal or accounting reasons. This means that things like contracts, signed proposals and invoices can be kept for multiple years if necessary (and required by your local laws for audits on financial or other records), even if your client asks you to delete their data.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Get compliant <\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These laws are already in affect, so get straight on to ensuring you\u2019re compliant. You\u2019ll feel better once it\u2019s done&#8230; and then you can get back to doing the fun stuff. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>GDPR is here. via GIPHY It\u2019s not often that new regulations make such waves.
