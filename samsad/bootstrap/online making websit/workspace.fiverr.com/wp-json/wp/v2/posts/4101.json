It doesn\u2019t have to be overly clever or cutesy, so long as it gets to the point and draws readers in. It should let them know what benefit they will gain from reading on. <\/span><\/li><li><b>Paragraphs: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Keep paragraphs short; no more than two to three sentences each. If you have a longer paragraph, break it into shorter pieces.<\/span><\/li><li><b>Subheadings, bullets, numbers:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> Break up blocks of texts with relevant subheadings, bullet points, numbers, or multimedia items (gifs are acceptable!).&nbsp;<\/span><\/li><li><b>Conclusion: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Give your conclusion a subheading of its own that sums up the piece (never use \u2018conclusion\u2019 or \u2018summary\u2019). Make sure it adds information &#8211; no need to repeat what\u2019s already been addressed.<\/span><\/li><li><b><\/b><b>Referencing: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Back up your points with sources from trusted experts or media outlets. When sourcing statistics, facts, or quotes, include a hyperlink to where the full report or study can be found elsewhere.<\/span><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b><i>Consider the flow<\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">: Does the article follow a singular, coherent flow? Is the content in a logical order? Is it easily scannable?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A quick checklist<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>\ud83d\udea8Important notes on format:<\/strong> Yep\u2014this is the boring part. But for consistency, we require all contributed articles to follow the same editorial guidelines. Please review (and re-review!) the checklist below before submitting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Check length:<\/strong> Is the piece more than&nbsp;1,000 words?<\/li><li><strong>Check flow:<\/strong> Does the article follow a singular, coherent flow? Does every word, paragraph and section count?<\/li><li><strong>Check relevance:<\/strong> Is the article written for freelancers, solopreneurs, digital nomads and\/or other segments of independent workers? Does the information conveyed directly relate to their&nbsp;specific challenges, goals or needs?<\/li><li><strong>Check tone:<\/strong> Is the article straightforward, yet conversational?<\/li><li><strong>Check your sources:<\/strong> Are your points clearly stated and backed by trusted experts or media outlets? Be sure to give proper credit by linking out to your original sources.<\/li><li><strong>Check images:<\/strong> Have you included supporting images (that don&#8217;t breach copyright laws) or screenshots?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While we&#8217;re at it, here are some additional rules of the road:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Contract words where it makes sense (e.g., use don\u2019t instead of do not).<\/span><\/li><li>Write out numbers one through nine. Use numbers for 10 and up.<\/li><li>Use em dashes without spaces\u2014like this.<\/li><li>Avoid using exclamation marks unless something is really, really exciting!<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p><b><i>Review your article: <\/i><\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Does every word, paragraph and section count? Could something be removed and it still make sense? Could it be more simple or direct?<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Advice from our writers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We spoke with some of our writers to hear what works for them. Here&#8217;s what they shared:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>&#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t be afraid to conduct interviews<\/strong>.
