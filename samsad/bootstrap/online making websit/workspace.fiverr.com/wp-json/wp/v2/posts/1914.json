It&#8217;s a must-have network that helps connect professionals with other individual professionals or companies. However, many freelance writers do not set up their profiles for finding jobs.&nbsp;<\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a few tricks to optimizing Linkedin as a freelance writer looking for work.<br><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>1. Include <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>the right keywords and skills on your profile<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every freelance writer\u2019s profile on Linkedin should include keywords that showcase their different talents. It is not enough to list yourself as a freelance writer, for example, you also must also include \u2018blogger,\u2019 if that applies, or other keywords like \u2018journalist,\u2019 \u2018health writer,\u2019 \u2018food blogger,\u2019 and more. The more specific these keywords get, the more chance companies looking for a freelancer with your expertise will find you.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>2. Utilize the blogging feature<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blogging on LinkedIn is a good way to showcase your talents and solidify your standing as a thought leader in your preferred field. Companies will have easy access to a portfolio of your work through this, so keep the posts informative and professional. You can even repost articles that you publish elsewhere with a link to the original publication. <\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This will work best if you build up a network of people who are interested in your niche, so they&#8217;ll be interested in what you&#8217;re writing about and more likely to hire you when they need a writer in that field.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>3. Navigate job boards in the right way<\/strong><\/span><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try paying more attention to the companies than the specific jobs. Since most freelance writers are not looking for full-time jobs, look for companies that interest you and, instead of applying to a specific job, ask if they are looking to work with any freelancers. This is a good way to pick up extra gigs from unexpected sources. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Fiverr<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiverr is a well-known freelancing platform where freelance writers can set up a profile advertising their talents. Its sole purpose is to connect freelancers with suitable jobs, and many of the gigs lead to repeat clients. There is a percentage attached that Fiverr takes to make its profit, so keep that in mind when setting your rate.&nbsp;<\/span><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fiverr is a no-brainer for freelance writers because it is easy to use, clients are charged automatically without you needing to worry about whether or not they&#8217;ll pay, and you can build up a profile full of positive feedback from clients. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flexjobs.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Flexjobs<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexjobs&#8217; targeted job search algorithm is helpful in finding jobs suited to every kind of writer. While this website provides only a paid service, it may be worth it for the expanse of quality freelance jobs listed and the quick connection to jobs. The monthly payment on this website also gives users access to all of the resources they need to find a good next gig.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexjobs has categories and subcategories that connect to every possible aspect of the freelance writing industry. So, when a job is suggested to a user, that job is actually suited toward their knowledge base. A good tactic for finding jobs on this website is to take as many of the skills tests as possible. This will make it easier for potential employers to find you. Additionally, be sure to create a resume directly on the website so potential employers do not have to go searching for it.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/angel.co\/?utm_source=redirect&amp;utm_campaign=angellist_com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>AngelList<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Startups are often looking for freelance writers to create quality content to enhance their website. From blogging to growth marketing and many more opportunities, writers and startups tend to overlap quite well.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is why AngelList is such a helpful tool. It is a job board that lists only job positions open in startup companies, and it is a great place to find companies that may be looking for freelance writers. What&#8217;s also great is that most jobs list key details about itself and the job they are hiring. Want to make sure you&#8217;re working for a credible startup AND want to know the pay range for this job? AngelList is great for that.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick to this website, like Linkedin, is to put freelance writing keywords in your profile and to connect with as many companies as you can. Applying to different positions on this website is as simple as clicking \u2018I\u2019m Interested,\u2019 and writing a brief paragraph about why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being able to reach out to the CEOs of startups on this website is an invaluable advantage. When you come across a company that interests you, go to their website and take a look at their blog, if one exists. Brainstorm content ideas that would be best suited to the company. After you have done your research, message the company to pitch your ideas. Putting yourself out there is the best way to connect with jobs on AngelList, so pitch as many companies as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have You Looked Here for Freelance Work?<\/span><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/AND_CO_19FreelanceWritingJobGoldmines_Artwork.jpg\" alt=\"freelance, freelancer, freelance writing, freelance goldmines, freelance jobs, find freelance jobs, freelance communities\" class=\"wp-image-2121\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/workingnotworking.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>Working Not Working<\/b><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working Not Working is a selective place for a range of creatives where top jobs are found for advertisers, copywriters, animators, or <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/workingnotworking.com\/signup\/creative\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">any other profession that appears on this list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

Best of all, these companies are the ones actually paying to be part of the community, so you know that they&#8217;ll want your bang for their buck. This should reduce some of the headache in finding less than ideal companies to partner with, which you might find on other obvious job destinations.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Also, it usually means you\u2019re getting offered the rate you deserve.
