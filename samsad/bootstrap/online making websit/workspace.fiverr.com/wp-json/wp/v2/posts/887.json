Freelancers are allowed a vast amount of freedom. Much like authors beholden to agents, they do not have work hours, simply deadlines. A full-time freelancer can wake up, open a laptop, and start work without leaving bed. Unfortunately, this much freedom does not breed productivity in everyone. There happen to be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/205202\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">several distractions that can easily get in the way of work<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Freelancers in cities, such as New York, however, have the advantage of being able to rent out coworking spaces, or temporary office spaces, in order to be able to work in a focused, professional environment. Being in an office environment, while maintaining autonomy, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/hbr.org\/2015\/05\/why-people-thrive-in-coworking-spaces\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">can make freelancers work harder and more efficiently<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> than they would at home alone. The below New York City temporary office spaces are some of the best for freelancers in the area. Freelancers bring their talent, and these spaces provide the rest. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Office Sharing:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pivotdesk.com\/locations\/us\/ny\/new-york-city\">PivotDesk<\/a><\/b><\/h2>\n<p>This is not so much one shared office space as it is many. PivotDesk is an office sharing marketplace that matches up companies with excess office space, with those that need it on a flexible basis. Offices with extra space are able to create a posting on the PivotDesk website detailing their availability and rates. Freelancers can peruse PivotDesk for available spaces. Once they find one they may like, they contact the host and the two exchange information and arrange a tour of the space. If the host decides the guest is a good match for their space, an invitation is sent and the guest is allowed to move in.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>A Space for New York&#8217;s Writers:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.paragraphny.com\/\">Paragraph<\/a><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any freelancer looking for a no-frills, no-nonsense, affordable space need not look further than Paragraph.
