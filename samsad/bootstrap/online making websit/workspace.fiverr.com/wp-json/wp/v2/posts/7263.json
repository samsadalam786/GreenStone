You get it.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Understanding the importance of referrals is not the issue.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>The issue is <em>asking<\/em> for them.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>You may not be sure what to say or how to say it. You may be naturally introverted and asking someone for a referral is way outside of your comfort zone. Or you simply don\u2019t have any experience asking for referrals and don\u2019t know where to begin.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Well, we\u2019re here for you, fam!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>We\u2019ve asked for referrals before and still do to this day.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re not naturally inclined to this kind of activity, it\u2019s a bit weird at first.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>But you\u2019ll get better and eventually become a referral-asking-pro.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>So, here are 13 tips that will help you become said referral-asking-pro.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>13 Tips for Asking for Referrals<\/h2>\n\n\n<h3>1. Build Value First<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, you need to build value with your customers. If they are not satisfied with your work, or they don\u2019t feel like it was worth the value, they aren\u2019t likely to offer a referral.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Whether it is your first time working with a client or your tenth, establishing value with your customers will make asking for referrals &#8211; and everything else on this list &#8211; easier.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>A simple way to build real value with a customer? Provide data that proves it. Something like a stat showing their return on investment in your services.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>2. Exceed The Customer\u2019s Expectations<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Do NOT overpromise with your client&#8217;s expctations for your services\/work.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Underpromise (or just promise naturally?) and overdeliver.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Next to building value, one of the best ways to make asking for referrals easier is to exceed the customer\u2019s expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>This one is a bit obvious, but when someone is clearly impressed by your work they are more likely to share that with others. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Make sure that happens \ud83d\udc46\ud83d\udc46<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Nothing makes a customer happy than delivering above their expectations.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>And, since they are obviously happy with your work, you know going into the conversation that they are more likely to say \u201cyes\u201d than \u201cno\u201d.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>3. Identify the Right Person to Ask<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>If your main contact is NOT &#8220;the boss&#8221; or &#8220;the person who actually pays you,&#8221; you might have a tough time getting a referral.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Identifying the right person to ask could be the difference in getting a referral or having your request lost in an email chain. <\/p>\n\n\n<p>And in some cases, it may not be the person you are working with the most.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Depending on your client, the person to ask will be the business owner, manager, or department head. <\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>If you\u2019re not quite sure who the right person is, ask yourself a simple question: who holds the purse strings to my project?<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>In many cases, whoever is paying for your services will be the right person to ask. If they aren\u2019t, see if they\u2019d be willing to set up a conversation with their boss and keep moving up the chain.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>4. Be Intentional With Your Ask<\/h3>\n\n\n<p><strong>I repeat: be intentional.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n<p>Super important.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Asking for a referral is a common business practice, but you should be clear about your intentions. If you\u2019re asking them to connect you with someone else, make it obvious that you are making this request.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t beat around the bush and try to sneak in that you\u2019d like a referral. Most business owners will respect your ability to be direct. On top of that, making it clear that you are asking for a referral will ensure you leave the conversation with a yes or no answer.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>5. Be Specific With Your Request<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>This is also super important.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>In addition to being intentional, being specific in your request will make it <strong>easier<\/strong> for your customers to referrer you.<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Are you looking for a long quote?<\/li><li>Short testimonial?<\/li><li>When do you need it by?<\/li><li>Do they know someone you\u2019d like to get in touch with?<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>Ask them specifically to connect the two of you.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>By being specific, you\u2019re letting your customers know exactly what you want from them. There is no gray area or room for interpretation that the customer needs to figure.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>6. Leverage Positive Feedback<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Did your client just tell you how wonderful of a job you did?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>That great! Now could be a perfect time to bring up a referral.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>When a client is giving you positive feedback, they are already thinking about the value you\u2019ve been able to bring to their business. Leverage that positivity to request that they share your name with others who could also use your services.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ll want to be a bit crafty in your transition from \u201cthank you\u201d to \u201cplease referrer me\u201d, but the conclusion of the conversation is a good place to make the request in this situation.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>7. Make it Easy for People to Know What You Do<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>In other words, be clear about what you specifically do to help your clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Do you manage social media handles? Do you consult on sales tactics?<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Making it very what you bring to the table will help clients understand your value and what you can do to help them.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Plaster it on your website, business cards, social media accounts, or wherever you do business. Customers want to know what you can do to help them. Make it easy.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>8. Create a Customer Referral System<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Creating efficient systems in your business is an important part of becoming more efficient and effective with your time. Referrals are no different.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>A referral system can be made in many ways, but it will usually consist of some rules like:<\/p>\n\n\n<ul><li>Setting referral goals<\/li><li>Identifying referral sources<\/li><li>Making a plan to reach out<\/li><li>Developing alert systems (like a newsletter or email campaign)<\/li><li>Following up<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n<p>You can get as fancy or as simple as you\u2019d like with your customer referral system, but creating one is a crucial step towards sustainable customer referrals.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>For more on creating a customer referral system, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/service\/customer-referral-program\">check out this article<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>9. Use a Template<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Using a referral template can make it easier for both you and your customer to ask for and give a referral.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Wording referral emails can be awkward and time-consuming, so why not create a template that does it for you?<\/p>\n\n\n<p>I\u2019d suggest two main forms of a template: 1) A template <em>you<\/em> use to request a referral; and 2) a template that your <em>customer<\/em> can use.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of a template you could use when asking for a referral:<\/p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>To:<\/strong> [Customer name]<\/p><p><strong>Subject: <\/strong>Referral Request<\/p><p>Hello [Customer name],<\/p><p>I&#8217;m so glad to hear you&#8217;re happy with the results of working with [Your name\/company name] so far. I knew we could help, and I&#8217;m pleased you&#8217;re seeing results so quickly.<\/p><p>Since things are going so well, I found myself wondering if you have any colleagues at similar companies who would benefit from our [product\/service]. I would love to help them achieve similar growth.<\/p><p>Regards,<\/p><p>[Your name]<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n<p>And, if the response is positive from your customer, you could share this simple referral template that they can fill out and press send:<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>To:<\/strong> [Referral name]<\/p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Subject:<\/strong> I\u2019d like to connect you with someone who has helped grow my business<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[Referral],<\/p>\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve mentioned it before, but I&#8217;ve been working with [name\/company name] for a few months. The other day, I was talking with her about some of the things she and I have done, and I realized I should put you two together. So&#8230;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[Referral], meet [name, with a LinkedIn profile URL].<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[Name], meet [Referral, with a LinkedIn profile URL].<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Can I leave the rest to you two?<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Talk to you both later.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Regards,<\/p>\n\n\n<p>[Your name]<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Of course, feel free to adjust these as necessary, find different templates across the web, or develop your own.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>What matters is having one &#8211; it makes outreach much easier!<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>10. Offer Incentives for a Referral<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Enticing your customers with some sort of incentive is a great way to increase referrals. It provides that small extra push to customers who are on the sidelines and is a pleasant bonus for a customer who was already thinking of sending a referral your way.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Offer an Amazon gift card, a discount on next month\u2019s services, or subscription to some sort of service for a period of time. If you\u2019re reaching out to your email list, you could even add some scarcity to the incentive by saying the first 5 or 10 people to respond to this offer with a referral will receive the prize.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Get creative and have fun with this one. You know your customers and your industry best, so offer something relevant or fun that you know people would like to have.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>11. Ask for a Positive Review<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Instead of asking a business to put you in contact directly with another customer, there are some cases where you\u2019d really just like for them to leave you a positive review.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Reviews are so important for establishing proof of products for your business. The review could be on Yelp or Google, it could be a quote from the customer that you publish to your website, or it could be an endorsement on LinkedIn.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You should ask for this review on whichever platform or medium from which you get clients.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>12. Create Partnerships<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Not everyone in your industry is a competitor. In fact, many businesses may provide services that are complementary to your own.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Find companies like this and form a relationship with them. Then, work with them to create a referral partnership whereby you recommend their services to your clients and vice versa.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>This kind of setup benefits your business, your partner\u2019s business, and your clients. It\u2019s a win-win-win situation.<\/p>\n\n\n<h3>13. Follow Up<\/h3>\n\n\n<p>Okay, listen up. If you do only one of these 13 things, it needs to be this one.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Follow up!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Too often we provide a service, the client says thanks, pays their invoice and that\u2019s the end.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Instead of payment being the end of the relationship, make it a new beginning. Follow up with them and ask for feedback, ask how things are working out, and ask if they could refer you to someone else.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Additionally, be sure to follow up on any referral requests you make. Even people with the best intentions get busy and forget to do something they said they would. A quick follow up email might be just the reminder they needed to give you that referral.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<h2>You\u2019ve got this!<\/h2>\n\n\n<p>Armed with these 13 tips for referrals, you\u2019re ready to get out there and start landing some high-quality leads and increasing sales.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You may not nail your first pitch, but don\u2019t let that discourage you.<\/p>\n\n\n<p>As long as the ask is coming from the right place, no one is going to hold it against you.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n<p>Keep practicing, keep asking, create systems to make your life easier, and good luck!<\/p>\n\n\n<p>You\u2019ve got this.<br \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I won\u2019t sugarcoat it&#8230; Asking for referrals can be more awkward than you&#8217;re 7th grade dance.
