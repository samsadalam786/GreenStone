Join the club. Per a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/181289\/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gallup survey<\/a>, 70 percent of the U.S. workforce is not engaged at work. That\u2019s right, most people trudge to the office without any sort of passion or connecting to the work they\u2019re doing.<br>If you feel this way, quitting your job might seem like the right solution, but of course it\u2019s easier said than done. Making the jump from fulltime to freelance can be terrifying, especially for someone who has never been self-employed. Yet, on the flipside, there\u2019s never been a better time to do it. There are more resources than ever before for finding freelance jobs, <a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">managing the day-to-day operations<\/a> inherent in self-employment, and keeping your projects and tasks in check.<br>In fact, quitting your job could be the best thing for your career\u2014if you approach it correctly. Here are just a few reasons why.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>\u201cSolopreneurship\u201d is not a fad; it\u2019s a way of life for many.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What your parents and professors told you a \u201ccareer\u201d was 15 years ago isn\u2019t the same thing as it is today. Quitting your job is okay. The\u00a0future of work\u00a0points towards better applications of skills, faster innovation, stability from diverse tasks and roles rather than dull commitment.<br>According to Upwork, there are\u00a055 million independent workers\u00a0in the United States today, and the growth is projected to increase dramatically. PwC estimates that by 2020, 50 percent of the U.S. workforce will be solopreneurs\u2014people who will have made their own careers by forging pathways outside of a more traditional trajectory.<br>Very soon, there will be no pressure against working for yourself and quitting your job, and there are already blogs and websites out there who are ready to help you take a leap towards independence. For example,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fiverr Workspace<\/a>\u00a0creates invoices, contracts, and timesheets for your freelance business in a few taps. Sites like Upwork, Fiverr and WeWorkRemotely help you uncover new business opportunities. The list goes on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/blog\/a-complete-guide-to-becoming-a-freelancer\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/workspace.fiverr.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/becoming-a-freelancer.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5679\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Your professional growth can be fueled by freedom and independence.<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take what makes you feel most unhappy about your current job and replace it with experiences that help you not only grow, but also flourish, as a businessperson. The odds of it happening are more realistic than you think.<br>Freelancing provides learning and stimulation for your life because you will do new things everyday. This is way different and way less monotonous than sitting at a desk and staring at a desktop screen all day. Once you quit your job, you also will have the ability to focus on more than one skillset you like, which provides a greater quality of life.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-1 wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fintent%2Ftweet%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.and.co%252Ffreelancersblog%252Ffreelance-knowledge%252Fquitting-job-go-freelance-best-thing-career%252F%26text%3DOnce%2520you%2520quit%2520your%2520job%252C%2520you%2527ll%2520gain%2520the%2520ability%2520to%2520focus%2520on%2520more%2520than%2520one%2520skillset%2520you%2520like.%2520%2540andco%26via%3Dandco%26related%3Dandco&#038;text=Once%20you%20quit%20your%20job%2C%20you%27ll%20gain%20the%20ability%20to%20focus%20on%20more%20than%20one%20skillset%20you%20like.%20%40andco&#038;related' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Once you quit your job, you&#039;ll gain the ability to focus on more than one skillset you like. @andco <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fintent%2Ftweet%3Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.and.co%252Ffreelancersblog%252Ffreelance-knowledge%252Fquitting-job-go-freelance-best-thing-career%252F%26text%3DOnce%2520you%2520quit%2520your%2520job%252C%2520you%2527ll%2520gain%2520the%2520ability%2520to%2520focus%2520on%2520more%2520than%2520one%2520skillset%2520you%2520like.%2520%2540andco%26via%3Dandco%26related%3Dandco&#038;text=Once%20you%20quit%20your%20job%2C%20you%27ll%20gain%20the%20ability%20to%20focus%20on%20more%20than%20one%20skillset%20you%20like.%20%40andco&#038;related' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/div><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>You will also learn new skills.
