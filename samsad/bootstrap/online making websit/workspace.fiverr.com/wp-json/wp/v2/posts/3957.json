If you know your name is going to be attached to a piece, that should give you additional motivation to help a client\u2019s article get found and shared. Think of giving your very best with freelance writing as an inbound marketing tactic to attract potential new clients, <em>while<\/em> you\u2019re getting paid to create it!<br \/>\nHere\u2019s how to get more freelance\u00a0writing jobs by going above and beyond for your clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Develop Topics<\/h3>\n<p>You probably will have to do this most of the time anyways, but why not position it as a perk of working with you? Many people hire for freelance writing jobs because they are at a loss when it comes to content marketing, especially with regards to what their audience actually wants to read.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s at this point that you should also give some insight into your process for working with clients. For example, I use <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trello.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Trello<\/a> as an editorial calendar for my clients, and I walk them through how we can both submit and agree upon topics, and how the client can then check in on them as they\u2019re in progress or published.<br \/>\nBasically, clients like to be reassured of their decision to hire you, and taking the time to talk about topic development sounds like you have it together.<\/p>\n<h3>Source Images<\/h3>\n<p>At the bare minimum, you should offer a feature image possibility or two for each article you write (assuming the client doesn\u2019t have a team in place for graphic design). Just make sure that the images you choose are legal to use, and include proper attribution, so that you and the client don\u2019t get in any legal trouble! The following free stock photo websites can be a good place to start your search for each article:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/librestock.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Librestock<\/a>: Compiles results from 40+ stock photo websites in one place (including go-tos like <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unsplash<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/pixabay.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pixabay<\/a>)<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/images.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Image Search<\/a>: Make sure that you click <em>Tools -&gt; Usage Rights -&gt; Labeled<\/em> <em>for Reuse<\/em> to find royalty-free options.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flickr.com\/creativecommons\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flickr Creative Commons<\/a>: Different licensing options, many are free to reuse. Make sure to follow directions regarding attribution.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you\u2019re <em>really<\/em> trying to impress a client, consider hiring someone to create an infographic, or collaborate with their graphic designer to make it happen. Make sure that your fee reflects this additional effort.<\/p>\n<h3>(Occasionally) Increase Word Count<\/h3>\n<p>Occasionally, write more than what\u2019s really required. But don\u2019t embellish or use filler words: this should be 100 percent about quality. Think of this as a way to surprise and delight clients, but not as a requirement.<\/p>\n<h3>Provide an Outline Before Writing<\/h3>\n<p>This will probably only help you get more freelance writing jobs if you\u2019re dealing with clients who like to be <em>very <\/em>involved in the content marketing efforts they otherwise delegate out. But even if they don\u2019t ask for it, providing an outline can be a good way to show that you\u2019re on the right track before getting in too deep with an article, by nipping any wasted effort in the bud. Make sure you present the outline as an editable document so that the client can add in their own two cents (Google Docs is good for this).<\/p>\n<h3>Include Onsite SEO Factors<\/h3>\n<p>SEO is the name of the game when it comes to content marketing, so the best way to get more freelance writing jobs (and charge more for them!) is to educate yourself about content SEO\/onsite SEO factors, then make sure each post includes these important pieces:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keyword research<\/strong>: Use a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/adwords.google.com\/ko\/KeywordPlanner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Keyword Planner<\/a> (free) to research keyword possibilities for articles, including traffic and competition levels. Additionally, consider what you know about the buyer\u2019s journey, and how to optimize for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.getspokal.com\/understanding-keyword-intent-and-how-to-convert-for-intent\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyword intent<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>At least 2 internal links<\/strong> from the client\u2019s website, and <strong>2 outbound links<\/strong> to high quality sources (per 500-1000 words).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A plugin like <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Yoast<\/a> allows you to designate a keyword and make sure you\u2019re using it everywhere it needs to be for ranking purposes, as well as help you apply additional\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/learn-the-basics-on-site-seo-101-for-wordpress-bloggers\/?l=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">onsite SEO best practices<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Conversion Factor (aka, a Call to Action)<\/h3>\n<p>The ultimate goal of content marketing is to get visitors to convert in some way. Although the highest goal is to create a sale, other conversions that help build a relationship are also desirable.<br \/>\nMake sure that you don\u2019t end a post without telling people what to do next. A few ideas if you\u2019re stuck:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tweet your thoughts at @CompanyTwitterHandle&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Get in touch here&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Sign up for the email list&#8230;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Another way to create a useful conversion factor is by creating <a href=\"https:\/\/clicktotweet.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click to Tweet<\/a> takeaways for especially good statistics or quotes throughout the article (if the client uses WordPress).<\/p>\n<h3>Create a Content Upgrade<\/h3>\n<p>A content upgrade is a conversion factor that encourages readers to take the next step with a company by creating a compelling reason to sign up for their email newsletter. A content upgrade can take the form of a super simple checklist, ebook, or printable document based on the article\u2019s topic.<\/p>\n<h3>Create Preview Text<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll consistently get more freelance writing jobs by helping your clients think through every possible element required in a finished post. One often forgotten but incredibly important piece is these various types of preview text, pre-written with your finished article:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Meta description<\/strong>: 160 characters or less, a teaser to search engine visitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Email teaser<\/strong>: ~100 words or so, helping the client tease a new blog post to their email subscribers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Social media copy<\/strong>: Teaser text for social sharing, with call outs for handles of any companies\/individuals mentioned in the article to encourage sharing.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Headline options<\/strong>: Sometimes one is not enough. Some clients like to see different possibilities. Consider adding a few\u00a0headline options based on the SEO keywords you\u2019ve identified.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Upload Post to Their CMS<\/h3>\n<p>This feature is especially useful for a client who wants to be completely hands off when it comes to managing their blog\/website and content marketing efforts. It\u2019s reassuring for potential clients to hear that you\u2019re a whiz with WordPress, so show them that you\u2019re the whole package when pitching new freelance writing jobs.<br \/>\nIf you\u2019re especially handy with navigating a CMS like WordPress, you can also use this opportunity to pitch a couple of\u00a0hours of web work as a retainer to help them out with updates. Upsell is a beautiful thing!<\/p>\n<h3>Conduct Interviews<\/h3>\n<p>Some clients have the material, they just don&#8217;t know how to translate it to written content. Offering to facilitate and &#8220;translate&#8221; interviews into a final piece of content will be very useful for some clients\u2014just make sure you&#8217;re charging for the time it takes to coordinate and execute the interview.<\/p>\n<h3>Share the Article with Your Social Followers<\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll only get more freelance writing jobs by pitching this if you have a <em>relevant<\/em> social audience to complement the client\u2019s brand and industry. If you <em>do<\/em>, make sure your potential clients know about it. Give numbers regarding followers and other statistics relating to sharing numbers with your pitches.<\/p>\n<h3>Be a Good Communicator<\/h3>\n<p>This means always keeping the client in the loop. It also means letting an editor know if you\u2019re going to be late in turning in an article\u2014at <em>least<\/em> a day before it would be due (and never the day of). You\u2019ll get even more freelance writing jobs by <em>never<\/em> turning in an article late. Remember, your reputation precedes you.<\/p>\n<h3>Ghostwriting<\/h3>\n<p>Some clients will ask you to create content without a byline. This can be a great opportunity, but you should certainly charge extra for others to take credit for your writing.<\/p>\n<h3>Get More Freelance Writing Jobs<\/h3>\n<p>Go above and beyond by adding some of these different pieces that are within your wheelhouse, and that you can provide with confidence. Then, make sure every client and potential client knows how capable you are by sharing your process on your services page.
