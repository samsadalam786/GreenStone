It\u2019s off brief<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you\u2019re suddenly given a new piece of information that was never revealed before or the client completely does a backflip on what they asked you for initially, receiving feedback that\u2019s contrary to your initial brief can be discouraging, as it can feel as though all your time working on the project has gone to waste. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while you\u2019re probably frustrated, snapping at your client about how they never told you this information in the beginning is unlikely to result in a solid working relationship for the remainder of the project, nor in additional work with them in the future. <\/span><br \/>\n<b><i>What to do about it: <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, let the client know that you\u2019re slightly confused by the feedback and want to clarify whether the brief has changed. Remind them of the brief you were working to &#8211; you could even resend it to them and ask them if they\u2019d like to make updates or provide a new brief. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have another discussion with them about what they\u2019re looking for from the project, and get confirmation that all stakeholders agree upon this. Set new expectations for timelines for delivery and if applicable, how much the project is going to cost (if you\u2019ve spent extra time on creating the initial version). Being direct with them about how the new feedback affects the project is the best way to ensure they make their expectations clear before you resume working. \u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-common-frustrations-with-client-feedback-and-how-to-overcome-them%2F&#038;text=Dealing%20with%20off-brief%20%23feedback%3A%20Be%20direct%20with%20your%20client%20about%20how%20it%20affects%20the%20project%2C%20to%20ensure%20they%20make%20their%20expectations%20clear%20before%20you%20resume%20working.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dealing with off-brief #feedback: Be direct with your client about how it affects the project, to ensure they make their expectations clear before you resume working.  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-common-frustrations-with-client-feedback-and-how-to-overcome-them%2F&#038;text=Dealing%20with%20off-brief%20%23feedback%3A%20Be%20direct%20with%20your%20client%20about%20how%20it%20affects%20the%20project%2C%20to%20ensure%20they%20make%20their%20expectations%20clear%20before%20you%20resume%20working.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. It\u2019s too vague<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2018I don\u2019t like it\u2019, \u2018It just doesn\u2019t feel quite right\u2019, or even \u2018<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitrebels.com\/design\/design-feedback-posters\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can you make the sandwich more playful?<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u2019 are just some examples of the kind of feedback that doesn\u2019t help you understand how to improve upon your work. <\/span><br \/>\n<b><i>What to do about it: <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask some clarifying questions. Is there something in particular you don\u2019t like? Can you show me an example that you <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">do<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> like? Is there something you would change about the initial brief in light of this?<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an idea of another direction you may be able to take, talk to them about that and ask whether they think it\u2019s more the kind of thing they\u2019re looking for. If it\u2019s not, don\u2019t be afraid to let them know that this feedback is not particularly helpful, and you\u2019ll need some more information in order to provide the next version.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>3. It\u2019s overly prescriptive<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The opposite problem occurs when you\u2019re given feedback that prescribes big changes to your project. It can be annoying when you know you\u2019ve created something specifically designed to reach your client\u2019s stated objectives, only to have them ask you to change crucial elements of your design or copy. Before you go ahead and change buttons, tone of voice, or content, talk to your client about their feedback.<\/span><br \/>\n<b><i>What to do about it: <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask why. Start by finding out if your client has some basis behind what they are asking for. They may not be a designer or a writer, but chances are they have some kind of expertise about their brand. Getting their explanation can not only help you understand what they are looking for (and how to approach future projects with them), it\u2019ll also give you a chance to offer your alternative. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If they don\u2019t have a strong, outcome-based reason behind their suggested change, let them know why you chose to create the asset the way you did. Talk to them about how you expect the target audience to interact with your design or copy, providing them with a story that demonstrates the journey you\u2019ve created for the user. This context can help them understand that rather than focusing on their personal preferences, they need to have an audience-focused approach if they\u2019re to be prescriptive. <\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you never know, taking the time to let them know what best practices or experience have informed your results could just change their mind about their feedback.<\/span><br \/>\n<span class='bctt-click-to-tweet'><span class='bctt-ctt-text'><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-common-frustrations-with-client-feedback-and-how-to-overcome-them%2F&#038;text=Provide%20clients%20with%20context%20to%20help%20them%20understand%20that%20rather%20than%20focusing%20on%20their%20personal%20preferences%2C%20they%20need%20to%20have%20an%20audience-focused%20approach%20when%20giving%20%23feedback.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Provide clients with context to help them understand that rather than focusing on their personal preferences, they need to have an audience-focused approach when giving #feedback.  <\/a><\/span><a href='https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkspace.fiverr.com%2Fblog%2F3-common-frustrations-with-client-feedback-and-how-to-overcome-them%2F&#038;text=Provide%20clients%20with%20context%20to%20help%20them%20understand%20that%20rather%20than%20focusing%20on%20their%20personal%20preferences%2C%20they%20need%20to%20have%20an%20audience-focused%20approach%20when%20giving%20%23feedback.%20&#038;via=andco&#038;related=andco' target='_blank' class='bctt-ctt-btn'rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Click To Tweet<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Moving forward<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I\u2019m not going to suggest that \u2018the customer is always right\u2019, there is an extent to which you need to remember who is commissioning your work.
