More people dream about side hustles than ever actually attempt to have one. Of those who do, many wind up lingering in the purgatory of occasional work, rather than turning their passions into full-time gigs.<br \/>\nKnowledge workers have a distinct advantage in that they can work from anywhere. At Workfrom, we\u2019ve seen remote workers all over the world clocking in from public libraries, airports, neighborhood cafes, and coworking spaces. No doubt many of them are working to turn their side hustles into something more. Some may still be toiling in office jobs by day, only to make strides on their preferred professions during off hours.<br \/>\nSure, some professionals prefer a guaranteed paycheck with the opportunity to earn some extra freelancing dollars. Others remain paralyzed by an imaginary goal: \u201cIf only I could reach X amount of income, I\u2019d quit.\u201d Those are the individuals\u2014let\u2019s call them the hopeful doubters\u2014who I hope to reach with this post.<br \/>\nSide hustles are indeed businesses. To that end, there\u2019s a point that fledgling tech companies often reach called the Trough of Disillusionment. It\u2019s a period of waning interest\u2014a lull that only the strongest (and most innovative) survive. It\u2019s where the proverbial rubber meets the road. And it\u2019s a point where those engaged in solo work outside of their primary job often stumble and run back to safety.<br \/>\nThere are ways to cross that divide strategically, however. Here are five things every side hustler needs to believe to turn their passion into reality:<\/p>\n<h3>You\u2019ve got clients waiting for you.<\/h3>\n<p>You already have a niche; you simply have to know how to define it. (Okay, so that\u2019s the less-than-simple part.) Start with what you know. What specific experience do you have? What industries have you worked in, and in which parts of the world? What types of companies are you familiar with? What skills have you acquired along the way? Taking the time to answer these important questions will help you narrow down your pool of potential clients. This may sound counterintuitive, but the smaller your target audience gets, the more these companies actually need your services, leading to a concentrated group of clients who are very likely to sign on with you.<\/p>\n<h3>Your skills set you apart.<\/h3>\n<p>Positioning yourself as a PR pro with experience in high-tech startups, a seasoned gaming app developer or a fashion blogger in emerging markets won\u2019t happen overnight. Thankfully, if one of these specific roles is your intended path, you (should) already have more than a few related projects under your belt. Analyze your past work, and take stock of your strengths holistically\u2014especially if they demonstrate an unusual combination of competencies.<\/p>\n<h3>You know how to calculate your worth correctly.<\/h3>\n<p>Pricing intelligently is easier said than done, especially when you\u2019re trying to win the job. But don\u2019t put winning above all else; work that doesn\u2019t compensate you adequately for your talents isn\u2019t worth doing. Experienced freelancers who have performed spec work joke about \u201cdying from exposure,\u201d but the point remains that you need to be strategic about what you take on in the hopes of gaining more business out of it. Negotiating for an acceptable rate will not only get you off on the right foot; it will put a spring in your step as you seek out more clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Your network is bigger than you think.<\/h3>\n<p>Your network is not your posse; it\u2019s not a tight-knit group that you hang out with on the weekends. These people can and should include your former classmates and professors, old and new colleagues, relatives from all over, peers in professional associations and volunteer organizations, and folks you\u2019ve met at networking events (like industry conferences, for example). When you cast a wider net initially, you enable more remote connections and possibilities for work. Letting others know that you\u2019re taking on new clients could be as easy as posting on your LinkedIn or AngelList profile, or dropping a quick DM to a few key contacts via Twitter.<\/p>\n<h3>You\u2019re a natural salesperson.<\/h3>\n<p>You love what you do, and you\u2019re good at it. If you believe that, you can convince just about anyone to hire you. Those who require too much convincing likely aren\u2019t worth pursuing\u2014a subject for an entirely separate post. Approach sales prospects as if you aren\u2019t engaging in some deceptive endeavor; instead, consider it from the perspective that you are helping individuals and companies to solve their problems. Nurturing new leads and asking for referrals won\u2019t be as difficult if you focus on how your services can improve others\u2019 bottom lines. You\u2019ll often find that others are happy to refer a qualified pro who \u2018gets\u2019 what companies need.<br \/>\nEvery side hustler looking to make their dreams a reality needs the right dose of confidence and skills to achieve their goals. Once you start living the truth of these five things mentioned above, you&#8217;ll be on your way to a professionally enriching life.<br \/>\n\u2014<br \/>\n<em><strong>Freelancers and other remote<\/strong><\/em><em><strong> workers can find plenty of workspace options on <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workfrom<\/a>\u2013a community-sourced search engine and virtual tribe that spans the globe. <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/join\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sign up for free<\/a> to scout spaces, check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/magazine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Untethered <\/a>blog for more remote-friendly posts, and consider joining your virtual tribe with a <a href=\"https:\/\/workfrom.co\/login?reauth=1#plans\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Workfrom membership<\/a>.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you&#8217;re engaged in some side hustles and looking to make your dreams a reality, then this article has the right tips for you.
